^00Mt. Hikami...^01~70~{LF}^00A place where many come to take their lives.^01~100~{LF}^00I'm positive that Fuyuhi must have come here.^01~150~
Fuyuhi!^01~25~
Haruka, she's here on the mountain.^01~103~
Have you seen her?^01~30~
^00No, but...she's here.^01~115~{LF}^00I...I have to find her.^01~85~
I wonder...^01~30~
^00Why did the two of us survive...^01~160~{LF}^00^01~107~{LF}^00We made a promise that we'd all die together.^01~166~
^00Why did the two of us survive...^01~120~{LF}^00We made a promise that we'd all die together.^01~166~
^00When will we get the chance^01~135~{LF}^00to join the others?^01~55~
Hey, I'll go and look for Haruka.^01~83~
Let's go back.^01~47~
Yuri?^01~120~
Fuyuhi, where are you?^01~75~
Close your eyes, think back to that day...^01~120~
Fuyuhi?^01~30~
^00Play with me forever...^01~130~{LF}^00^01~30~{LF}^00I know Iâ€™ll remember you^01~200~{LF}^00^01~370~

Forever and ever-^01~175~
Forever and ever-^01~100~
Ah...^01~120~
Haruka!^01~60~
You've seen too much.^01~70~
^00You cannot leave the mountain.^01~90~{LF}^00^01~65~{LF}^00You will dissolve into nothing.^01~80~
^00You cannot leave the mountain.^01~67~{LF}^00You will dissolve into nothing.^01~60~
Um, excuse me...^01~45~
Um, excuse me...{LF}Hello^01~45~
^00I'm looking for Hisoka Kurosawa.^01~70~{LF}^00Is she here?^01~40~
Oh, I'm sorry, but she's stepped out.^01~120~
^00My name is Fuyuhi Himino.^01~90~{LF}^00I've been waiting for her to tell me if...if...if she could{LF}help me find someone.^01~180~{LF}^00I still haven't got a reply from her...^01~60~
You're looking for someone?^01~40~
^00She might have gone to the mountain.^01~70~{LF}^00...Mt. Hikami.^01~50~
Mt. Hikami...^01~50~
^00Someone told me^01~65~{LF}^00that they saw my friend there.^01~55~
It's an infamous suicide spot, isn't it?^01~100~
^00I don't know why Haruka would go to a place like that.^01~155~{LF}^00And without even saying a word to me...^01~95~
Don't worry. As soon as Hisoka gets back, I'll tell her...^01~85~
No, that's fine. I can't wait any longer.^01~100~
I'll go look for her myself.^01~70~
Huh? Come back!^01~50~
Huh? Come back!^01~110~
