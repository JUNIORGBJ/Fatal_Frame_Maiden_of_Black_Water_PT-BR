This is it. This is where the Ghost Marriages were carried out.^01~210~
Ceremonies to unite the deceased{LF}in matrimony... Or so I thought.^01~270~
Here, Outsiders are beckoned to the mountain{LF}and bound to an Immortal Flower...{LF}^00A shrine maiden marked for sacrifice.^01~330~
These rituals join the deceased not with each other,{LF}but with the living.^01~210~
Postmortem Photographs are used as votive pictures...^01~210~
The Outsiders, enchanted by these photos,{LF}are wed to the shrine maidens depicted in them.^01~270~
And then...placed together in the same box.^01~210~
The shrine maidens, is this what they were for?{LF}Did they long to become a bride...for eternity?^01~450~
I have been waiting.^01~120~
You will come for me, won't you?^01~150~
Soon, I will dissolve.{LF}Dissolve, and vanish completely.^01~300~
This will be our final meeting.^01~150~
Will you end yourself with me?^01~120~
I won't let you escape this time.^01~120~
As I thought, she only has eyes for you.^01~150~
You see...^01~60~
I've waited for so long.^01~90~
