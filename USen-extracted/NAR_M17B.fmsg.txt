^00I must have passed out.{LF}This mist isn't a good sign.{LF}{LF}^00Is Rui OK?
^00I can't stop thinking about what Rui said.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00What I'm looking for is in my study?{LF}{LF}{LF}^00What does it mean?
^00I found this photo in my family's storeroom,{LF}together with the Camera Obscura.{LF}It belonged to the man I saw in my dream, Dr. Aso.{LF}^00I can use it to follow his trace.{LF}It may finally shed some light on Mt. Hikami's past.{LF}^00I want to know what he was doing there.{LF}And how to put an end to all this.
^00The Camera Obscura was in this box when I found it.{LF}{LF}^00This must mean it belonged to Dr. Aso.{LF}^00It looks like there's something else inside.
^00If this was left behind by Dr. Aso,{LF}then the dream of the ritual...was a memory of his?{LF}^00That girl, she's waiting for the person she gave this lock of her hair to...{LF}For Dr. Aso.{LF}^00What did he see on Mt. Hikami?{LF}And how is it related to the current events?{LF}{LF}^00This photograph and the lock of hair might lead to the answers I seek.
^00Yuri's gone.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00Has she been taken back to the mountain again?
^00I had that box the camera was in when I found it...{LF}{LF}{LF}^00It belonged to Dr. Aso.{LF}I should check if it doesn't hold any other useful items.{LF}{LF}^00I put it away somewhere in this room.
^00What did Dr. Aso do?{LF}What can I do? What should I do?{LF}{LF}^00I need to see for myself.
^00Is this Dr. Aso?{LF}{LF}{LF}^00The only person who left Mt. Hikami alive.{LF}But what was he doing here? What did he take pictures of?{LF}{LF}^00If I try photographing what he's looking at, I may just find some clues.
^00The path leading up the mountain.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00This place used to be called Maiden Grove.{LF}This is where pilgrims chose the shrine maiden to accompany them.{LF}^00A shrine maiden...who would oversee their demise.
^00This is the Pool of Purification.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00Pilgrims would undergo a rite of purification here.{LF}{LF}^00Soaking in these waters would make them one with the mountain{LF}and bring them closer to the world of the dead.{LF}^00The shrine maidens always kept their raven-black hair soaked.{LF}They were known as Maidens of Black Water...
^00The girl with white hair.{LF}{LF}^00She gave a token to Dr. Aso when he was a boy{LF}and later came to this mountain.{LF}{LF}^00Then she waited for him to come back to her, guided by the token.
^00The Forbidden Valley.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00Outsiders who participated in Ghost Marriages were buried here.{LF}{LF}^00Whether the ceremony was a success or not, they were all interred.
^00In time, Mt. Hikami became known as a haunted place{LF}where people come to commit suicide. It seemed to attract death.{LF}^00Many young girls who disappeared ended up here,{LF}and probably stayed here as Pillars...
^00Mt. Hikami is a mountain of death.{LF}A place people are drawn to when they want to die.{LF}^00What did those shrine maidens mean to the people who came here to die?{LF}{LF}^00What did the grooms see in their long-dead brides?{LF}{LF}^00And Dr. Aso, what did he think of it all?{LF}{LF}^00The things he wanted to see...he wanted to do...{LF}The places he wanted to visit. The people he wanted to meet...
