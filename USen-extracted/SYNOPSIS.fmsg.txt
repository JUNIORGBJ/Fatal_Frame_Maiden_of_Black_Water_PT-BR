- Spirited Away -{LF}{LF}In the vicinity of Mt. Hikami, people have been mysteriously{LF}disappearing without a trace.{LF}{LF}One such girl is Miu Hinasaki. She awakens to find herself in an{LF}old, half-flooded building.

^00- Shadow Reading -{LF}{LF}Among the residents of the villages at the foot of Mt. Hikami,{LF}a certain unique ability has been passed through the ages.{LF}{LF}This ability, known as "shadow reading," enables the user{LF}to view the shadow, or "trace," of someone lost in inexplicable{LF}circumstances. This is not unlike the "psychometry" practiced{LF}elsewhere.{LF}{LF}Yuri Kozukata accompanies Hisoka Kurosawa, a woman who{LF}possesses the shadow reading ability, to an abandoned inn on{LF}Mt. Hikami.{LF}^00Sensing Yuri could in time become talented at shadow reading,{LF}Hisoka takes her along on an assignment.

A few days have passed since Yuri's introduction to{LF}shadow reading at the abandoned inn.{LF}{LF}Since then, Hisoka has gone off somewhere and hasn't returned.{LF}Yuri worries for Hisoka, but isn't sure how or where to start{LF}searching.{LF}{LF}As she sits waiting at the antiques shop, a girl named Fuyuhi{LF}Himino shows up, claiming to have enlisted Hisoka to help{LF}her find a missing person.

Ren Hojo, a writer, is haunted by a recurring dream in which he{LF}kills a young girl during a ritual.{LF}{LF}He receives an album of Postmortem Photographs, located on his{LF}request by Hisoka. Upon viewing one of the photos, Ren{LF}recognizes the very scene from his dreams.{LF}{LF}Eager to delve further into this puzzling mystery, Ren heads to{LF}the abandoned inn in person this time, bringing along his{LF}assistant, Rui Kagamiya.

With Hisoka still missing, Yuri recalls what she witnessed on the{LF}mountain: Fuyuhi, taking her own life while entranced by a{LF}malevolent spirit, and the bodies of dead shrine maidens washed{LF}up at the Pool of Purification.{LF}{LF}These disquieting images leave Yuri with no doubt that{LF}Mt. Hikami houses some kind of horrifying secret.{LF}{LF}Yuri takes the Camera Obscura that she found on the mountain{LF}and begins searching for a token that will lead her to Hisoka.

After finding a missing persons file on Hisoka's desk,{LF}Yuri realizes Hisoka had been looking for Haruka Momose.{LF}{LF}She recalls what Fuyuhi said when they passed the Shrine of Dolls:{LF}"Haruka... She's here."{LF}{LF}With this in mind, Yuri heads to the Shrine of Dolls, hoping that{LF}if she finds Haruka, she may just learn of Hisoka's whereabouts{LF}too.

After being brought back from the mountain, Haruka{LF}disappeared again. This time, she seemed to be led away{LF}by the ghost of her friend, Fuyuhi.{LF}{LF}Yuri recalls one more open case from Hisoka's file:{LF}A missing girl named Miu Hinasaki, who went to{LF}Mt. Hikami in search of her mother.{LF}{LF}Yuri takes Miu's token with her and sets out for the mountain,{LF}hoping that the key to all the disappearances will be waiting there.

In the course of their investigation, Ren and Rui learn of{LF}Keiji Watarai, a folklorist who settled on Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}His writings are certain to be a treasure trove of information{LF}about the mountain and its peculiar folklore. Ren and Rui{LF}happen across a video tape that may just indicate the way{LF}to Watarai's residence.

Yuri managed to rescue Miu from the Shrine of the Ephemeral,{LF}but obtained no new information about Hisoka.{LF}{LF}The only clues she has are a photograph found in the Camera{LF}Obscura and the vision she saw when she touched Hisoka's charm.{LF}These lead Yuri to believe Hisoka is somewhere upstream.{LF}{LF}Clinging to this last hope of finding her friend, Yuri heads towards{LF}the Lake of the Departed, located on Mt. Hikami's summit.

When Yuri returns from Mt. Hikami's summit,{LF}she quickly collapses from exhaustion.{LF}{LF}Meanwhile, Miu is also in an unnaturally deep slumber.{LF}{LF}Worried that some unwanted visitors may be on their way,{LF}Ren and his assistant Rui decide to watch over the girls through{LF}the shop's surveillance system.



Miu wakes up to discover that Yuri has been taken to{LF}Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}She borrows Yuri's Camera Obscura and heads for the mountain,{LF}against Ren's advice.{LF}{LF}She hopes not only to find Yuri, but some clues to her mother's{LF}whereabouts as well.

Ren checks the surveillance footage only to discover that Rui has{LF}also been beckoned away to the mountain.{LF}{LF}He recalls the dream he had after he fell asleep:{LF}Rui was inside the Veiled House, a.k.a. the Watarai Residence.{LF}{LF}Ren knows this is where he must head next.

Yuri ponders what she saw at the Lake of the Departed:{LF}Hisoka's shadow vanishing into a thick veil of mist.{LF}{LF}She recalls the tall torii gate rising from the lake,{LF}marking the entrance to the Shrine on the Water.{LF}{LF}Could Hisoka be in that shrine?{LF}Yuri knows she must find a way across. She goes to investigate{LF}the Shrine of the Ephemeral.

Having brought Yuri back from the Lake of the Departed,{LF}Miu stays awhile at the antiques shop.{LF}{LF}Convinced her mother, Miku Hinasaki, is somewhere on{LF}Mt. Hikami, Miu knows the only way to find her is to{LF}follow her shadow.{LF}{LF}To do so, she needs the help of Yuri's Camera Obscura.

^00Rui, Miu, Miku, Hisoka and Yuri all fall into an{LF}unusually deep slumber.{LF}{LF}Ren fears that while this persists, the defenseless group{LF}may be vulnerable to attack. Time to get back to those{LF}surveillance cameras.{LF}{LF}^00Ren knows he must find out what's going on with Mt. Hikami{LF}before something comes to pay a visit...

The glow of the Dark Sun fades away and the{LF}sleeping girls regain consciousness.{LF}{LF}The mountain calls to our three protagonists.{LF}Their individual mysteries await resolution.

Ayane is a ninja from the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan's{LF}Hajinmon sect.{LF}{LF}Her mission: To search for a missing girl, Tsumugi Katashina,{LF}last seen near Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}Ayane spins a Purple Thread which should help lead her to the girl.

When confronted by spirits from the Netherworld, Ayane is forced{LF}to make a fast retreat from the mountain.{LF}{LF}She heads in search of a means to fight her new opponents.

The Purple Thread leads Ayane to the Shrine of the Ephemeral{LF}on Mt. Hikami's summit.{LF}{LF}She heads inside the old shrine, which seems to{LF}exude darkness itself.

Within the Shrine of the Ephemeral, Ayane locates Tsumugi{LF}and rescues her from the Black Water. The next step is{LF}to plan their escape.{LF}{LF}Surrounded by evil spirits, Ayane knows she has to think fast.
^00Miu, a girl who has been "spirited away,"{LF}awoke in a flooded mansion.{LF}{LF}While searching for the exit, she came across a room with{LF}nothing but a large, black box inside.{LF}{LF}As the box opened, what emerged from within{LF}was not of this world.{LF}{LF}With no one there to hear Miu's scream,{LF}her voice was lost in the mist.
^00While learning about shadow reading from Hisoka, Yuri used{LF}the ability to retrieve an album of Postmortem Photographs{LF}from a ruined inn on Mt. Hikami. The album was requested{LF}by a certain Ren Hojo.{LF}{LF}As Ren awoke from a bad dream, he found himself{LF}tormented by uncertainty.{LF}{LF}Was it really just a dream? Or a suppressed childhood memory?{LF}{LF}This question has plagued him for some time.
While searching for her friend,{LF}Fuyuhi Himino ended up taking her own life.{LF}{LF}Having witnessed Fuyuhi's final moments,{LF}Yuri knows she wasn't alone when she died.{LF}What of that other woman who killed herself in the same way?{LF}Not to mention the mysterious shrine maiden,{LF}sodden from the rain...{LF}{LF}Yuri managed to locate Hisoka's Camera Obscura,{LF}along with a charm she always liked to wear.{LF}For now, she must return to the antiques shop alone.
The photo album left behind by the innkeeper was put together{LF}by a folklorist who lived on Mt. Hikami. As Ren and Rui{LF}explored the inn and traced the spirit of its owner, a ghost{LF}tried to lure Rui to suicide. Then, through the pouring rain,{LF}an ominous shrine maiden appeared.{LF}{LF}Ren and Rui left the mountain with more{LF}questions than when they started.
Using the Camera Obscura, Yuri found a number of missing{LF}person case files connected to Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}She is now more determined than ever{LF}to head back to the mountain and find Hisoka.
^00Yuri finds the missing Haruka Momose in a reliquary in{LF}a cave beneath the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}{LF}She takes the girl back to the shop. Haruka is in no state to{LF}talk and can't explain what happened to her.{LF}{LF}That night Haruka is visited by Fuyuhi's ghost,{LF}which takes her back to the mountain.
Miu Hinasaki was found in a reliquary within{LF}the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}{LF}Yuri attempted to glance the sleeping Miu's memories,{LF}but found the tables turned against her.{LF}{LF}It seems Miu also possesses the same{LF}shadow reading abilities as Yuri.
^00Ren and Rui set out to find the folklorist's house,{LF}relying on clues from a video recording.{LF}{LF}As they passed through the Shrine of Dolls,{LF}the white-haired girl from Ren's dreams appeared.{LF}{LF}She asked why he didn't bring her token, then vanished.{LF}^00Ren and Rui arrived at the Veiled House, where they{LF}discovered several of Keiji Watarai's writings on the customs{LF}and beliefs surrounding Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}They escaped the house, only to see it{LF}vanish in a thick veil of mist.
^00Yuri followed Hisoka's trace to the shore of{LF}the Lake of the Departed, where it vanished into the mist.{LF}In her place, a woman appeared: the same dark presence{LF}seen in Hisoka's photograph. Unable to inflict any damage{LF}with the Camera Obscura, Yuri's only option was to run.{LF}{LF}Yuri recalled the outline of a large torii gate over the misty lake.{LF}Could that be where Hisoka was headed?
Ren is watching over the sleeping Yuri and Miu on the{LF}surveillance cameras, but he passes out. He has a dream{LF}where he's chasing after Rui. When he wakes up, both Yuri{LF}and Rui are gone. He finds Miu getting ready to leave for{LF}Mt. Hikami, taking Yuri's Camera Obscura with her.{LF}The door shuts behind Miu, leaving a bewildered Ren behind.

^00As Yuri waded into the mist over the Lake of the Departed,{LF}she was stopped by Miu.{LF}{LF}The distance between the girls seemed to narrow.{LF}Losing their parents at a young age and being able{LF}to see into the souls of others... The girls have more{LF}in common than they may have first realized.{LF}^00Yuri still hasn't found Hisoka, while Miu still searches{LF}for her mother, Miku.{LF}{LF}The eerie dark figure that appeared at the lake may just{LF}hold all the answers. But why does she keep calling out to Yuri?
^00Ren found Rui in a reliquary in the Veiled House, only{LF}to be pulled in himself. He awoke in an unfamiliar building.{LF}{LF}An old woman dressed in white led Ren to a room in which{LF}Rui was waiting, dressed as a bride. This seemed to be the room{LF}in which weddings between the living and the dead are held.{LF}^00Rui suddenly changed into a fearsome bride wearing black.{LF}Then, in a flash, they were back in the folklorist's house.{LF}{LF}There, they encountered Ren's friend Kazuya, whose own{LF}wedding to a ghost went horribly wrong.{LF}{LF}The Veiled House vanished into the mist, with Kazuya still inside.
Yuri boarded the Boat of Passage and was taken to{LF}the Shrine on the Water, the final destination for{LF}shrine maidens set to become Pillars.{LF}{LF}Yuri found Hisoka inside the shrine and took her safely{LF}back to the antiques shop.{LF}{LF}The bond between the two of them grew even stronger.
^00Miu finally found Miku on Mt. Hikami, where she had{LF}entered into a Ghost Marriage at the House of Joining.{LF}{LF}Miku explained her desperate wish to be reunited with her{LF}beloved, pleading for Miu's forgiveness. {LF}{LF}Miu led her mother away from the mountain{LF}and back to the antiques shop.{LF}{LF}Miu and Miku lay side by side and quickly fell into a deep sleep.
^00Ren learned of the true purpose of the rituals{LF}performed on Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}The mountain acts as a boundary between the world of the living{LF}and that of the dead. A place at which the souls of visitors{LF}were returned to the water from which they were born.{LF}{LF}Shrine maidens absorbed the memories of the dying, and when{LF}they could take no more, they were sacrificed in reliquaries.{LF}{LF}^00Ghost Marriages served to console and strengthen the souls{LF}of those sacrificed. Wedded couples were thrown into the{LF}darkness that leads to the Netherworld.{LF}{LF}Water connects everything.
^00Having absorbed the painful memories of countless ghosts,{LF}Yuri felt the mountain calling for her. She made her way{LF}toward the Shadowspring, lying beneath the Shrine on the Water.{LF}{LF}Awaiting her there was Ose Kurosawa, the Immortal Flower.{LF}As Yuri touched Ose, she shared in her immense pain, suffering,{LF}and solitude.{LF}^00Ose, finally freed from her grief, returned to{LF}the Shadowspring alone.{LF}{LF}Yuri left the mountain together with Hisoka. As they reached{LF}the base, a thick mist descended once more on Mt. Hikami,{LF}covering it from view.
^00Having absorbed the painful memories of countless ghosts,{LF}Yuri felt the mountain calling for her. She made her way{LF}toward the Shadowspring, lying beneath the Shrine on the Water.{LF}{LF}Awaiting her there was Ose Kurosawa, the Immortal Flower.{LF}Yuri and Ose shared the same pain, alienation and grief.{LF}Together, they ceased to exist.{LF}{LF}They are no longer alone.
^00Ren roamed around Mt. Hikami, guided by{LF}the memories of Dr. Kunihiko Aso.{LF}{LF}Aso's trail led Ren to the House of Joining, where his own{LF}Ghost Marriage would be held.{LF}{LF}There, his chosen bride awaited him. Ren was to be wed{LF}with the bride from the photograph, Ose Kurosawa.{LF}^00Ose finally gained the closure she had longed for,{LF}releasing Ren from the mountain's grasp.

Ren was to be wed with{LF}the white-haired girl from his memory, Shiragiku.{LF}^00Shiragiku finally gained the closure she had longed for,{LF}releasing Ren from the mountain's grasp.
Miu and Miku watched as the Dark Sun sunk into the Black Water.{LF}{LF}"I'm glad I didn't take you with me."{LF}{LF}Miku's final words resonated with Miu as she watched{LF}her mother fade into the Black Water. Miu was left alone,{LF}bitter tears flowing from her eyes.
^00Miu and Miku watched as the Dark Sun{LF}sunk into the Black Water.{LF}{LF}"I'm not going anywhere."{LF}{LF}Lies.{LF}{LF}Miu awoke to find her mother sleeping next to her.{LF}{LF}^00They embraced, as if each making sure the other was real.{LF}For a moment, Miu felt truly happy. Even if this moment would{LF}turn out to be fleeting...
Ayane agreed to look for a missing girl named Tsumugi.{LF}{LF}Stealing herself into the abandoned inn on Mt. Hikami,{LF}she was severely wounded by a malicious ghost.{LF}{LF}How can she fight off these supernatural foes?{LF}Ayane made her escape, realizing she may need the help of{LF}forbidden magic...
Ayane cast a spell on herself, bringing her closer to death.{LF}Enveloped in darkness, she followed a purple thread{LF}connected to her target, Tsumugi.{LF}{LF}The thread led her to the Shrine of the Ephemeral,{LF}located on the summit of Mt. Hikami.
Ayane searched the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}{LF}She located and rescued Tsumugi, who was{LF}being swallowed by the Black Water.{LF}{LF}An unsettling presence surrounded the pair.{LF}Beings from the Netherworld were all around.
Ayane escaped from Mt. Hikami with Tsumugi.{LF}{LF}She left the girl with a simple message:{LF}{LF}"The stronger your bonds with others, the stronger{LF}you yourself become."{LF}{LF}As Ayane turned to leave, Tsumugi replied:{LF}"I'll...get strong."
