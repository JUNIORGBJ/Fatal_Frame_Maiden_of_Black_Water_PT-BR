^00Ose had exceptionally strong psychic abilities.{LF}She had been chosen to be drowned in the{LF}Shadowspring as the main Pillar of the faith.{LF}{LF}So that she did not just disappear, she needed to{LF}enter into a Ghost Marriage. A votive picture{LF}was commissioned.{LF}{LF}^00Rumors of Dr. Aso and his Camera Obscura,{LF}which could capture the subject's soul, had{LF}reached Mt.

Ose, destined to endlessly relive those{LF}shrine maidens' last moments alone in the dark,{LF}withstood the pain for a time but she will not{LF}last much longer.{LF}^00The protective seal surrounding the mountain{LF}has long been maintained by turning local girls{LF}into Pillars.

Mt. Hikami

Pool of Purification
^00A spot by the old path to the shrines on{LF}Mt. Hikami. The path passes by a few waterfalls,{LF}and the pilgrims used to clean themselves in their{LF}crystal clear water before proceeding to the{LF}shrines.{LF}^00The pool below the Maiden Fall, used by shrine{LF}maidens, was particularly beautiful.

Hikami.{LF}^00According to a legend, the true shrine maidens{LF}of Mt.

Unfathomable Forest

It was built as part of the project aiming{LF}to turn the mountain into a tourist destination.{LF}{LF}^00However, after a landslide destroyed most of it,{LF}only parts remain. Some areas have flooded and{LF}are now fenced off.{LF}{LF}Since the mountain became infamous as a suicide{LF}spot, many curious occultists have broken{LF}through those fences.{LF}{LF}^00Belongings of missing people can be found {LF}there.

Womb Cavern
^00An enormous lava cave which possibly stretches{LF}out to cover the whole area of Mt. Hikami.{LF}Several entrances have been discovered.{LF}{LF}Much of the cavern is flooded, so only parts are{LF}accessible without specialist equipment.{LF}^00In the past, water was deified on Mt. Hikami{LF}and the worshippers thought of the mountain as{LF}a divine being, with the cavern serving as its{LF}womb. The cavern was a most sacred place, and{LF}access to it was restricted. The entrances were{LF}cordoned off with sacred ropes.{LF}^00When the mountain was being developed for{LF}tourism, a newly made tunnel broke through{LF}one of the cavern walls. Water rushed into the{LF}tunnel, drowning dozens of workers. Many{LF}thought the disaster was brought on by a curse{LF}incurred by disturbing such a spiritual place.

Police officers stationed at the{LF}foot of the mountain came to investigate the{LF}house, and found it abandoned. No one could{LF}tell what became of the folklorist. Afterwards,{LF}the house itself disappeared, and the whole{LF}incident was forgotten.{LF}^00Now, tales of the house have resurfaced. People{LF}say it appears on foggy days, and that Keiji's{LF}works will still be found in there. Others say he{LF}is still there, continuing his research. If anyone{LF}dares enter, then Keiji, keen to study the darker{LF}local rituals, will kill them as sacrificial offerings.
About the Watarai Residence
Mt. Hikami Cable Car
^00The cable car was introduced in the hopes it{LF}would increase the number of tourists. There{LF}are three stops on the line: Mikomori,{LF}the Unfathomable Forest, and the Shrine of the{LF}Ephemeral. Soon after it was opened a huge{LF}landslide hit, and it had to be shut down.{LF}^00The tourists stopped coming, and the line never{LF}reopened. Some claim the construction work,{LF}which involved leveling part of the mountain{LF}and cutting a route through the forest,{LF}desecrated the sacred ground and brought a curse{LF}upon the line.{LF}^00Nowadays fans of the occult, attracted by rumors{LF}of ghosts seen in the empty carriages, or eerie{LF}silhouettes of people glimpsed in the forest by{LF}the rail track, come to take photos of the{LF}abandoned train.
About the Mt. Hikami Cable Car
Hikami Tunnel
^00A tunnel constructed as part of the project to{LF}make the mountain a tourist spot. It was{LF}supposed to go to the Twilit Peak on the{LF}summit. As the tunnel was being dug, the{LF}construction workers broke through to{LF}the Womb Cavern and the tunnel flooded.{LF}None of the workers survived.{LF}^00Work on the tunnel resumed, but the{LF}development plans for the mountain were{LF}abandoned and the tunnel was never completed.{LF}A road goes up to its eastern exit, but it has been{LF}closed due to the number of trespassers who{LF}have either died or have gone missing in and{LF}around the tunnel.{LF}^00There may still be a way to get from the tunnel{LF}into the Womb Cavern, but the locals warn that{LF}the ghosts of the accident victims and of shrine{LF}maidens await any who try to find it.
About Hikami Tunnel
Shrine of the Ephemeral
^00A large shrine near the summit of Mt. Hikami.{LF}It is thought to have been the main shrine of the{LF}local faith, but little is known about it. In the{LF}brief period that the mountain was visited by{LF}tourists, the shrine doors stood open, and people{LF}could admire the countless lanterns in the main{LF}hall.{LF}^00The shrine was abandoned after the closure of{LF}the cable car line. Remains of shrine maidens are{LF}said to be found in the inner rooms. Some say{LF}if one passes by the shrine on a foggy day, the{LF}lanterns will be lit and a Maiden of Black Water{LF}will be waiting.
About the Shrine of the Ephemeral
Forbidden Valley
^00A valley near the summit of Mt. Hikami which{LF}houses an ancient cemetery. It had been left{LF}undisturbed until land developers decided to{LF}create a path to the summit for the tourists. The{LF}only way was through the Forbidden Valley.{LF}A massive landslide flooded the valley,{LF}destroying the path.{LF}^00The graves were once exhumed in an attempt to{LF}establish who was buried there but no bodies{LF}were found. It is thought that the graves were{LF}erected in memory of people who did not have{LF}remains. Another theory is that the graves were{LF}for the shrine maidens who were sacrificed to the{LF}mountain.
About the Forbidden Valley
Twilit Peak
^00An area of land on top of Mt. Hikami, covered{LF}in volcanic rock. It is a desolate landscape,{LF}devoid of vegetation due to volatile gases{LF}escaping from the rocks. Locals felt it looked like{LF}the underworld and, along with the Lake of the{LF}Departed, it was considered to be connected to{LF}the Netherworld.{LF}^00Locals believe it is a sacred place. A sacrificial{LF}mound erected over a pile of caskets can be{LF}found here, as well as the Rear Shrine of Dolls,{LF}with dolls much older than those from the main{LF}Shrine of Dolls, located farther down{LF}the mountain.
About the Twilit Peak
Lake of the Departed
^00A crater lake located on the Twilit Peak on{LF}Mt. Hikami. The name of the lake comes from{LF}its ghostly appearance - it is surrounded by a{LF}white sandy beach and is always enshrouded in{LF}mist.{LF}^00Legend has it that a few times a year, when the{LF}last rays of the setting sun reflect off the lake,{LF}the mist clears and it becomes a link between the{LF}worlds of the living and the dead. People living{LF}near the mountain are advised to stay indoors on{LF}such days, lest a calamity befall them.{LF}^00However, it is also said that those seeking death{LF}may enter the waters of the lake and cross that{LF}dread threshold.{LF}{LF}This may refer to the practices that were part of{LF}the local faith. The pinwheels stuck in the sand{LF}might have been left there by the believers to{LF}comfort the spirits of children who crossed to{LF}the Netherworld there.
About the Lake of the Departed
Hall of Fire
^00The hall where the eternal Forbidden Flame was{LF}kept. This undying fire was the source of the{LF}flames used in local rituals.{LF}{LF}The use of sacred flames is documented in many{LF}religions, but those on Mt. Hikami had a unique{LF}use for the fire.{LF}^00The Forbidden Flame kept the Black Water from{LF}pouring out of the Shadowspring. It was{LF}necessary to carry the flame in order to safely{LF}approach the Black Water. The Flamekeepers{LF}in charge of tending the fire were required to{LF}purify themselves before being allowed near it.
About the Hall of Fire
House of Joining
^00The place where the wedding ceremonies for{LF}shrine maidens who became Pillars were held.{LF}{LF}The House of Joining exists between our world{LF}and the Netherworld, and is where sacrificed{LF}maidens were wed to men brought to the{LF}mountain.{LF}^00Only men chosen as suitable grooms could find{LF}the house. Once inside, they would first choose a{LF}maiden from among those whose votive pictures{LF}were hung on the wall.{LF}^00They would proceed to the Chamber of Vows,{LF}where their chosen bride would be waiting.{LF}Again, only the groom would be allowed into{LF}the chamber. Afterwards, the bride would return{LF}to her casket with the groom in tow, in order to{LF}spend eternity there with him as a Pillar.
About the House of Joining
Shrine on the Water
^00A shrine built on the Lake of the Departed. It{LF}appears as if it is floating on the water's surface.{LF}The lake feeds all the springs on the mountain{LF}and the shrine is believed to give its blessing to{LF}the water.{LF}^00The large torii gate which marks the shrine{LF}entrance can be seen from the shore on days{LF}when the mist is thin. The main building was{LF}destroyed a long time ago and nothing of it now{LF}remains. There is supposed to be a spring under{LF}the shrine, but its precise location is unknown.
About the Shrine on the Water
The Shadowspring
^00A vast spring of dark water, accessible through{LF}the Shrine on the Water.{LF}{LF}The Black Water is said to be from the{LF}Netherworld, to which the Shadowspring is an{LF}entrance.{LF}^00The Dark Sun hangs in the sky above,{LF}illuminating the murky waters with its eerie{LF}orange glow resembling the dying rays of light{LF}at sunset. This light lures people towards it, until{LF}they vanish into the endless dark.
About the Shadowspring

Camera Obscura
^00A camera with the power to expose that which{LF}normally remains hidden.{LF}{LF}Invented by Dr. Kunihiko Aso, a researcher of{LF}the occult. The special film it uses captures traces{LF}of beings which are not of the world of the{LF}living.{LF}^00Several of these cameras exist, but as each was{LF}made as a prototype their appearance and{LF}capabilities differ. Most of them are broken now{LF}and no one knows how to repair them.{LF}^00The cameras are highly sought after by{LF}collectors, despite rumors of them being cursed.{LF}The collectors either see that as another unique{LF}property and a risk worth taking, or they{LF}discredit such talk as mere superstition.{LF}^00Just like Hisoka there are people who use the{LF}cameras as tools for specialist work. However,{LF}such people tend to already have the ability to{LF}sense the ephemeral. Some say that the broken{LF}cameras aren't broken at all; the users do not{LF}have the ability to make them work.
About the Camera Obscura
Postmortem Photography
^00The original intention behind Postmortem{LF}Photography was to give the mourning relatives{LF}something to remember their loved ones by.{LF}The bodies were dressed in the finest clothes,{LF}and their faces made to look as if they were alive.{LF}^00At a time when photographs were a luxury very{LF}few could afford, Postmortem Photographs{LF}offered a chance to capture an image of their{LF}beloved. Dr. Kunihiko Aso, with his Camera{LF}Obscura, had been invited all over Japan to take{LF}such pictures. Most of them are on Mt. Hikami.{LF}^00Postmortem Photographs were especially{LF}treasured by those living on and around{LF}Mt. Hikami. They believed that a camera{LF}captures the soul of the photographed person,{LF}preserving it unchanged for eternity.
About Postmortem Photography
Shadow Reading
^00Shadow reading, not unlike psychometry, {LF}is the ability to see the "traces" related to lost{LF}items or people who have been spirited away.{LF}In the past, this ability was fairly common in the{LF}Mt. Hikami area. Nowadays very few have the{LF}knowledge necessary to perform it.{LF}{LF}Those who still use the ability are thought to be{LF}the descendants of Mt. Hikami shrine maidens.
About shadow reading
Traces
^00Shadows of the past, seen when shadow reading.{LF}Through contact with a token of the lost person{LF}or object, a person possessing psychic abilities{LF}can sense its trace, showing them where to go.{LF}{LF}People with particularly strong abilities will see{LF}the form of their quarry, and not just a shadow.{LF}^00The traces will attract malevolent ghosts, so it is{LF}dangerous to spend too long gazing at them.{LF}Yet another risk lies in following the trace of a{LF}person who has already died or has been{LF}spirited away, as you may be inadvertently{LF}following them into the world of the dead.
About traces
Tokens
^00Tokens are used in shadow reading. They are{LF}objects which carry a trace of a person or object{LF}that has gone missing. {LF}{LF}A person with the shadow reading ability is able{LF}to follow that trace to find that which is lost.{LF}They can be anything: items that the subject{LF}liked, strands of hair, letters or diaries that{LF}mattered to them very much, or photographs,{LF}to name a few. {LF}^00It is also possible to use items which{LF}belonged to dead people to follow their trace to{LF}lost or hidden items, but that kind of{LF}shadow reading carries with it great risk.
About tokens
The Netherworld
^00The world of the dead. It is a place of{LF}never-ending night, permanent darkness. Where{LF}the Netherworld connects to the world of the{LF}living the sky glows as if in the light of the{LF}setting sun. The light beckons those unfortunate{LF}enough to see it towards a darkness they will{LF}never escape.
About the Netherworld
Shrine Maidens
^00Ghosts of shrine maidens often appear on{LF}Mt. Hikami. The shrine maidens used to look{LF}after those who came to the mountain to end{LF}their life. They were all murdered and became{LF}ghosts.{LF}{LF}There is a story that long ago the shrine maidens{LF}were killed and their bodies washed up into the{LF}Pool of Purification.{LF}^00Now dead, they continue to{LF}carry out their duties. Their dark gaze awakens{LF}suicidal thoughts within any who find themselves{LF}on Mt. Hikami.
About the shrine maidens
The Veiled House
^00Disappearing houses have been the subject of{LF}many folk tales and urban legends. Some say{LF}that they hold untold riches. The Veiled House{LF}of Mt. Hikami is a different case. It is said those{LF}who enter it are never heard from again.{LF}^00The house exists on the border between our{LF}world and the Netherworld. The ghost of its{LF}owner continues to haunt it and any who enter{LF}are doomed to become trapped between worlds.
About the Veiled House
Effigies
^00A doll in which a soul has been sealed. They{LF}were used in rituals in lieu of real people. When{LF}they are made to closely resemble a person, that{LF}person's spirit is said to be transferred to the{LF}doll. Then, should the doll be destroyed, the{LF}person it represented will die in the same{LF}manner.{LF}^00The custom of concealing effigies that was{LF}practiced on Mt. Hikami is said to have grim{LF}roots. In times of famine children would be led{LF}into the mountains to die, told that they were{LF}playing a game. But perhaps the custom reflects{LF}the old practice of ritual human sacrifices.
About effigies
Children of the Shrine
^00These were girls up to the age of seven who{LF}served as shrine maidens. The custom of offering{LF}a young daughter to a shrine was practiced on{LF}Mt. Kagiroi, near Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}People used to believe that the souls of young{LF}children were not yet fully anchored in their{LF}living bodies.{LF}^00There was a saying, "The gods have your soul{LF}until seven years old," which reflected the view{LF}that young children's souls did not yet belong to{LF}the material world.
About the Children of the Shrine
Pillars
^00A long time ago in Japan, when large structures{LF}such as bridges or castles were built, young{LF}maidens were buried alive under the foundations{LF}or in the walls as offerings to the gods.{LF}^00These human sacrifices were believed to make{LF}the buildings stronger and protect them from{LF}destruction, as the maidens would forever watch{LF}over them. They were called "Pillars," and would{LF}support the spells and wards that kept evil{LF}forces out of our world.
About Pillars
Returning to Water
^00In the Mt. Hikami faith, souls are born from the{LF}water, so to return to it is to die.{LF}{LF}Dying in the waters of the mountain was seen as{LF}the right way to leave this world, and it was this{LF}act that was known as "Returning to Water."{LF}^00Only those who were seeking this death would{LF}be permitted onto Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}While it is a common belief that souls of suicides{LF}become cursed, "Returning to Water" did not{LF}carry that stigma and was thought to enable a{LF}peaceful and restful death.
About returning to water
Glance
^00The ability to glance into a person's soul, read{LF}their mind, see their memories, and reveal their{LF}secrets. Only those with strong shadow reading{LF}abilities can do this, but even they will usually{LF}only see an abstract vision of the emotions of the{LF}people they touch.{LF}{LF}Yuri needs physical contact to glance into{LF}people's souls, but for especially powerful users,{LF}they merely have to look you in the eye.
About the Glance ability
Pure Water
^00Crystal-clear water found on Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}Water was worshipped on the mountain and the{LF}clear spring water was seen as something{LF}extremely precious. The worshippers called it{LF}"Pure Water."{LF}^00Even during the mountain's development as a{LF}tourist spot, those involved believed that{LF}maintaining the high quality of the local water{LF}would please the gods of the mountain.{LF}{LF}According to legend, the Pure Water was the{LF}source of life. Its opposite was the Black Water,{LF}the source of death.
About Pure Water
Black Water
^00Old tales from Mt. Hikami speak of Black Water,{LF}the waters of death which poured out from the{LF}Netherworld. It was the dark counterpart to{LF}the Pure Water.{LF}{LF}Shrine maidens performed rituals to prevent it{LF}from overflowing into our world.
About Black Water
Tainted
^00If one is drenched in Black Water, the water of{LF}death, it will slowly consume a person's body.{LF}It will bring them closer to the Netherworld{LF}even as they're still alive. The Black Water taints{LF}the soul, eventually turning it into a ghost.{LF}^00Only the sacred flame can clean off the{LF}Black Water. This special fire had been carefully{LF}maintained on Mt. Hikami. Those who die from{LF}being tainted by the Black Water become ghosts,{LF}with Black Water pouring out of their mouths{LF}and eyes. They drag the living into the dark.
About being tainted
Boat of Passage
^00A boat which took passengers from the Shrine{LF}of the Ephemeral to the Shrine on the Water.{LF}Only shrine maidens who had glanced into{LF}enough people's souls and were suffocated with{LF}grief could board it. It would take them over the{LF}lake without the need to steer.{LF}^00Should any other person enter the boat, it would{LF}sail into the mist and return to the shore, empty.
About the Boat of Passage
The Dark Sun
^00The forever-setting sun that bathes the{LF}Shadowspring, the border between our world{LF}and the Netherworld, in its glow.{LF}{LF}It only reveals itself to those who are seeking{LF}death. Its haunting beauty guides them to the{LF}other side.{LF}^00The souls of the people who follow it to the{LF}Shadowspring resemble shadows, gazing up{LF}into the Dark Sun as they slowly vanish from{LF}our world.
About the Dark Sun
Ghost Marriage
^00A posthumous wedding. The tradition of Ghost{LF}Marriage differs from place to place. It was{LF}performed mostly for those who died at a young{LF}age without ever having married, to bring them{LF}happiness in the afterlife.{LF}^00Participants would be represented by an effigy{LF}or a photograph during the ceremony in which{LF}their soul is wed to a living groom or bride. On{LF}Mt. Hikami, the weddings took place between{LF}sacrificed shrine maidens and Outsiders{LF}brought to the mountain.{LF}^00The practice was carried out in order to{LF}strengthen the maidens drowned in the{LF}Shadowspring as Pillars; they were believed{LF}to last longer when joined in the darkness{LF}by a partner.{LF}{LF}The grooms were free to choose which shrine{LF}maiden they wanted to marry.{LF}^00If the wedding was successful, the bride would{LF}take the man back with her to the casket in{LF}which she had been drowned. In the event the{LF}wedding did not go as planned, the groom{LF}would be shut in a reliquary and placed in the{LF}water.
About Ghost Marriages
Immortal Flowers
^00This term refers to the shrine maidens drowned{LF}in the Shadowspring as sacrifices. The maidens{LF}were shut in boxes filled with Black Water. The{LF}water brought them close to death and gradually{LF}eroded their bodies. But if their resolve was{LF}strong they would retain their physical form.{LF}^00While in the caskets, being suspended between{LF}life and death, the shrine maidens would not age.{LF}Their beauty being immune to the effects of time{LF}inspired people to call them Immortal Flowers.
About Immortal Flowers
Shadowborn
^00A child born from a union between a living{LF}person and a ghost. Tales of such children are{LF}rare but can be found in many parts of the{LF}world.{LF}^00Shadowborn were generally feared and detested{LF}as being of the Netherworld, but in some parts{LF}people revere them for their strong psychic{LF}abilities.
About the Shadowborn
Reliquaries
The reliquaries were ornate wooden boxes used{LF}on Mt. Hikami for ritual sacrifices. Shrine{LF}maidens would be shut in the reliquaries, which{LF}would then be placed into the waters.{LF}{LF}The ritual was believed to preserve the beauty of{LF}the Pure Water and prevent the Black Water{LF}from tainting it.
About the reliquaries
Caskets
Ornate caskets that were used for ritual{LF}sacrifices. Only the most powerful shrine{LF}maidens were put in these caskets. The caskets{LF}were bigger than the reliquaries so that the{LF}grooms from the Ghost Marriages could join the{LF}shrine maidens in them for eternity, keeping{LF}the Pillars strong.
About caskets
Shrine Maidens - 2
^00Shrine maidens were central to the Mt. Hikami{LF}faith. They would accompany people who came{LF}to the mountain to end their life, and be{LF}witnesses to their last moments. Pilgrims would{LF}choose a maiden before entering the mountain.{LF}^00The maidens would absorb their feelings and{LF}thoughts. After a time, the maidens' hearts{LF}would overflow with these emotions. They{LF}would take that pain with them into the{LF}caskets and reliquaries, which would then be{LF}sunk into the water.{LF}^00Long ago a man called Kyozo Kururugi killed{LF}the shrine maidens and their bodies washed up{LF}into the Pool of Purification, tainting it with{LF}their blood. This resulted in them becoming{LF}beings of the Netherworld.{LF}^00They continued to ensure those who come to{LF}Mt. Hikami die a proper death. A few of the{LF}maidens survived and left the mountain. It is{LF}said that they settled in the villages at the foot{LF}of Mt. Hikami and that their abilities live on in{LF}their descendants.

Glance - 2
