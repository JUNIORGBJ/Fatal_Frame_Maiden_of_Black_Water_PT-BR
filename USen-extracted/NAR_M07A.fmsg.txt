^00^30~067~Miu Hinasaki.{LF}It says here she went to Mt. Hikami looking for her mother.{LF}^00I can use this photo to find her trace,{LF}which should show me exactly where she went.
A light is glowing dimly on the driver's console.{LF}It looks like the power is on.
^11~14~I can use the control panel{LF}to get the cable car running.
You pushed the cable car switch.
I need to go and look for Miu.
A small boat is floating in the courtyard.
^00The Shrine of the Ephemeral...{LF}^00Miu is inside.
^00An ornate black box.{LF}It looks slightly different from the one Haruka was trapped in.{LF}^00It's shut.{LF}Could Miu be inside?
The camera is reacting to something...
^00There's something in the picture...{LF}^00There's light pouring down from the ceiling.
^00There seems to be another floor above this one.{LF}The shaft in the ceiling leads up there.
^00There is a space in the middle of the altar,{LF}as if something should be placed there.
^00There's some kind of hatch behind the altar.{LF}Maybe it's connected to the room below.{LF}^00I can't get it to open.{LF}^00The camera is reacting to the altar...
I have to find the places shown in the photos.
^00^30~051~You placed the ^11~09~Dark Sun Mirror^10 on the altar.
^00There's something in the photo...{LF}^00It's someone standing in a room with caskets...
^00It's a person standing in a small boat...

^00All the lights are out. Maybe the lightning{LF}caused the circuit breaker to kick in.{LF}^00There must be a power switch around here somewhere.
^00All the lights on the control panel are out except this red one.{LF}^00That must be the main power switch.
^00You pushed the main power switch.
^00The power's back on.{LF}^00Now we can get down the mountain.
^00According to the tourist brochure,{LF}there's a tunnel nearby.{LF}It opens up to the rooftop of the old inn.
This way leads to the summit.{LF}I want to be going down, not up.
I've got to hurry and get Miu off this mountain.
Miu is too tired for a long walk.{LF}We should use the cable car to get down.
That's as far as the cable car goes.{LF}There must be a path somewhere.
This path leads farther up the mountain.{LF}We're looking for a way down right now.
Right now we have to focus on getting out of here.
Miu didn't come this way.{LF}I need to follow her trace.
The door is being held shut by a powerful force.
There must be a path that leads to the inn.
^00Rubble is blocking the door.{LF}^00You cleared the rubble away.
The cable car started moving.
The ghost dropped something when it disappeared.
^00Miu is in this "Shrine of the Ephemeral"...{LF}^00I have to find her and get her out of here.
