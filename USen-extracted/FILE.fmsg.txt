Mt. Hikami's Downfall
A book about spiritual activity on Mt. Hikami.{LF}It had been left in a hallway in the abandoned inn.
^00Mt. Hikami has long been considered holy{LF}ground. For centuries people have been drawn to{LF}the many sacred shrines and places of worship,{LF}as well as the natural features such as the Twilit{LF}Peak and the Pool of Purification, which have{LF}themselves been treated with great reverence.{LF}{LF}^00The mountain was also popular with tourists and{LF}mountain climbers for the beauty of its abundant{LF}clear waters and ancient, mysterious forests. {LF}Worshippers and hikers alike used to find rest{LF}at Ichiru Manor, a hot spring resort near{LF}the foot of the mountain.{LF}{LF}^00Now, the inn lies desolate, devoid of visitors.{LF}{LF}The mountain never recovered from a{LF}devastating landslide it suffered many years ago.{LF}The shrine road to the summit was cut off and{LF}the flow of the water throughout the mountain{LF}was altered, forever changing the landscape.{LF}{LF}^00New roads that were under construction had to{LF}be abandoned, and Ichiru Manor was buried{LF}under a slew of rock, resulting in numerous{LF}fatalities. Among those lost were the family of{LF}Ichiru Manor's proprietor, effectively putting{LF}an end to the business.{LF}Mt. Hikami's days as a tourist destination were{LF}no more. Instead, the mountain gained notoriety{LF}as a suicide spot.{LF}{LF}^00Perhaps because it was traditionally a{LF}destination to which the dying would venture, the{LF}mountainis now a place for those wishing to end{LF}their own lives. By extension, it has also become{LF}a place for thrill-seekers interested in the occult.
An old, dusty book has been left in the hallway.{LF}Maybe someone dropped it?
Letter from Fuyuhi
A letter from Fuyuhi Himino, left on Hisoka's desk.{LF}It relates to a missing person case.
^00Dear Ms. Kurosawa,{LF}{LF}Please find Haruka. She went missing over a{LF}week ago. You do still take on missing person{LF}cases, don't you?{LF}{LF}I've contacted the police, but they're no help.{LF}They say she was probably "spirited away."{LF}^00Haruka wouldn't have gone anywhere without{LF}telling me. I'm certain something bad has{LF}happened.{LF}{LF}I can handle my own grief, but I can't stand the{LF}thought of her suffering somewhere. What if{LF}she's waiting for me to find her?{LF}{LF}I'm worried sick.{LF}^00Haruka is still alive. I know it. But something{LF}has to be done, and quick.{LF}{LF}Remember when you found that precious picture{LF}of me and Haruka?{LF}{LF}I was so happy to have it.{LF}Now I need your help once again.
^00An open envelope has been left on the desk.{LF}The sender's name reads "Fuyuhi Himino."{LF}{LF}^00This must be Fuyuhi's missing person request.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00Maybe it could provide some clues as to where Hisoka and Fuyuhi went.
Lost Item Case Files
A book of lost item case files, with details on various cases.{LF}It was left on Hisoka's desk.
^00Client:{LF}Missing Item: Diary{LF}Token: Photo of the deceased{LF}Details: Locate mother's diary.{LF}     Client seeks info on their late{LF}     mother. Relates to a deceased{LF}     individual - apply caution.{LF}Results: The caretaker of the{LF}     deceased had burned the diary{LF}     at her request.{LF}^00Client:{LF}Missing Item: Storeroom Key{LF}Token: Photo of the deceased{LF}Details: Locate storeroom key.{LF}     Item may already be lost.{LF}     Token and item belonged to{LF}     deceased - apply caution.{LF}Results: Item located. Had{LF}     been hidden by client's parent.{LF}     Returned to the client.{LF}^00Client:{LF}Missing Item: Diamond Ring{LF}Token: Ring's box{LF}Details: Client seeks lost{LF}     engagement ring. Requested{LF}     fiancé not be notified. Date{LF}     of wedding soon approaching.{LF}Result: Found on client's desk.{LF}     Was in an obvious place, but{LF}     somehow eluded the client.{LF}^00Client: Ren Hojo{LF}Missing Item: Album of{LF}     Postmortem Photographs{LF}Token: Postmortem Photograph{LF}Details: Reference material for{LF}     a book about traditional{LF}     practice in Mt. Hikami area.{LF}     Bad location, but minimal{LF}     danger anticipated. Client is{LF}     an acquaintance.{LF}^00Result: Found in old building{LF}     of abandoned inn.{LF}     Shadow attempted to drag{LF}     Yuri toward the Netherworld.{LF}     Should have gone alone.{LF}     Must warn Yuri to stay away{LF}     from the mountain.
^00A folder reading "Lost Items" sits on the desk.{LF}Looks like it's bound by string.{LF}{LF}^00These seem to be notes on Hisoka's shadow reading cases.
The Art of Shadow Reading
A book about shadow reading. Looks like it's a firsthand account.
^00Shadow reading is the ability to read traces of{LF}the past, not unlike the ability commonly{LF}known as "psychometry."{LF}{LF}By following these traces, it is possible to find{LF}things that have gone missing, or which were no{LF}longer visible; things that are demonstrably{LF}there, but for reasons unknown are all but{LF}invisible.{LF}^00Things the owner wished to be forgotten;{LF}things whose owners have passed away;{LF}things that no longer wish to be seen;{LF}things drawn partway into the Netherworld,{LF}invisible within our own.{LF}{LF}Such items can be "called back" to{LF}the world of the living.{LF}^00Unlike these objects, however, people who have{LF}been spirited away must not be chased after{LF}lightly.{LF}{LF}In many such cases, they have been taken by{LF}creatures of the Netherworld, who linger nearby.{LF}Utmost caution must always be applied.
There's a book next to the files, entitled "The Art of Shadow Reading."
The Deathly Mountain
A book from the office of the antiques shop.{LF}It was mixed in with some of Hisoka's antiques.
^00Mt. Hikami has long been feared to be haunted.{LF}In the past, it was said that sleeping with one's{LF}feet facing the mountain was taboo.{LF}{LF}Watching the sun set behind the mountain, too,{LF}was believed to invite forth beings from{LF}the Netherworld.{LF}^00Today, the mountain is said to call to those{LF}fascinated by death. Countless rumors abound of{LF}people spirited away to that accursed peak.{LF}{LF}They are said to venture to the mountain alone,{LF}leaving behind no trace of themselves.{LF}{LF}Some say the bodies of those who vanish can be{LF}found at the bottom of the Lake of the Departed{LF}on the mountain's summit.{LF}^00Since becoming a tourist destination,{LF}the prevalence of such frightening tales did{LF}seem to diminish for a while.{LF}{LF}^00Even so, despite its fleeting status as a tourist{LF}hotspot, Mt. Hikami is yet to shake its{LF}reputation as a cursed mountain: a place of{LF}death.{LF}Today, it has become a popular place at which to{LF}commit suicide.
^00A book about Mt. Hikami was lying on the bookshelf.{LF}{LF}^00It seems to be about the traditions surrounding the mountain.
Suicide at Mt. Hikami
An old tome found in the shop's office.{LF}It's relatively new for one of Hisoka's purchases.
^00How does a place become famed for suicide?{LF}{LF}As more people die, the place will gain{LF}a reputation, and people are drawn to these{LF}spots out of a desire not to be alone in the end.{LF}{LF}Interestingly, these suicide spots are{LF}rarely known as hotspots for spiritual activity.{LF}^00This is what makes Mt. Hikami distinct from the{LF}others.{LF}{LF}It has both a tradition of suicide, and has long{LF}been associated with ghost sightings.{LF}{LF}Then, there are the so-called "Maidens of{LF}Black Water."{LF}^00It is said that if you are found by one of those{LF}maidens, they will lead you to your death. Those{LF}caught in the maidens' gaze never again leave{LF}the mountain, or so the rumors go.{LF}{LF}There are also tales of specters on Mt. Hikami{LF}who relive their own deaths. Those who do not{LF}die in accordance with local practices become{LF}cursed, forced to relive their final moments{LF}for eternity.{LF}^00Many of the people who have been kept from{LF}committing suicide on Mt. Hikami claim to have{LF}seen a maiden, or one of these looping specters,{LF}and felt a strong compulsion to kill themselves.{LF}{LF}^00Perhaps it is because of these stories of maidens{LF}and ghosts that the mountain continues to be a{LF}popular spot for those looking to take their own{LF}life.
^00A book about Mt. Hikami was lying on the bookshelf.{LF}{LF}^00It seems to be about the rumors surrounding Mt. Hikami{LF}as a site of spiritual activity.
Note from a Tent
Found in a tent in the Unfathomable Forest.{LF}It seems to describe a shrine maiden.
^00How long have I been here?{LF}I suppose it doesn't matter.{LF}{LF}I'm glad I decided to do things right and come{LF}here to die. This place feels right.{LF}{LF}I thought I might get lonely, but there are{LF}people here. People who aren't alive.{LF}^00This place may be as strange as people say.{LF}{LF}{LF}I heard children playing just now.{LF}I tried to get a look at them, but they ran off{LF}before I could get close.{LF}{LF}Did they come here on their own?{LF}Or were they left here?{LF}{LF}^00Earlier, I heard the sound of raspy breathing and{LF}running.{LF}{LF}After that, I heard a scream.{LF}{LF}I was scared, and held my breath. I'm not scared{LF}of death, but THAT was terrifying.{LF}{LF}^00I saw a woman dressed in white today.{LF}{LF}She was draped in cloth, so I couldn't see her{LF}face. She seemed to stare at me for a while,{LF}then left.{LF}{LF}Which side is she on, I wonder?{LF}Will she be back?{LF}^00I saw her again. She turns up every day,{LF}watching me. I feel her gaze, but not her{LF}presence.{LF}{LF}As soon as I notice her, she disappears.{LF}{LF}She must be constantly watching me.{LF}^00I heard a voice.{LF}{LF}A mournful voice, like screaming.{LF}No... Like singing.{LF}{LF}It was a call of some kind.{LF}{LF}But not for me. Not yet.{LF}{LF}My time is yet to come.{LF}^00{LF}{LF}{LF}Everything I brought with me is gone.{LF}{LF}Now I have nothing.{LF}{LF}{LF}{LF}^00I like it here. Nothing matters now.{LF}{LF}This was the right choice.{LF}I'm glad I came.{LF}{LF}She will come soon.{LF}{LF}She will take me away.{LF}^00{LF}{LF}{LF}{LF}She is calling.{LF}	          I must go.
A scrap from a notebook. It looks like it fell from the sleeping bag{LF}poking out of the tent.
Sunken Note
A note found in the Unfathomable Forest.{LF}The handwriting looks feminine.
^00Watching the sunset makes me want to cry.{LF}{LF}I have no home to go back to.{LF}{LF}Nobody would be there if I went back.{LF}Everyone would be there, yet no one would.{LF}{LF}I know that now.{LF}^00That's why I came to the mountain.{LF}{LF}My grandma used to tell me never to go to the{LF}mountain at sunset, but my feet led me here.{LF}I chased the sun and it kept getting bigger.{LF}{LF}I couldn't stop.{LF}^00I felt the need to write something,{LF}so I'm scribbling this down.{LF}{LF}I had to go into the water.{LF}I had to write this first.{LF}I had to write something.{LF}{LF}What else should I write?{LF}{LF}^00She's calling to me.{LF}{LF}I have to go.{LF}{LF}Before the sun sets.
A tattered note is floating at the edge of the marsh.{LF}It looks recent.
Crumpled Note
A note dropped in the Unfathomable Forest.{LF}It seems to have been severely crumpled.
^00The tales I read about Mt. Hikami were true.{LF}{LF}I can't handle any more death.{LF}{LF}I've seen that girl hang herself over and over.{LF}I've had enough.{LF}{LF}When I try to run, I wind up back here.{LF}^00I found myself mimicking her.{LF}My body moved on its own, just like that girl.{LF}I felt I was doing the right thing.{LF}{LF}As I hung there, my final thought was that death{LF}takes a long time to come.{LF}{LF}I watched the sunset...{LF}^00When I awoke, I was back here.{LF}{LF}I should already be dead.{LF}{LF}Will I be forced to see that sunset again?{LF}To go through it all again?{LF}{LF}{LF}{LF}^00I am fading, bit by bit.{LF}{LF}I must go.
There's a slip of crumpled paper on the ground.{LF}Something seems to be written on it.
Apparent Suicide Note
Some paper found in the Unfathomable Forest.{LF}It appears to be a suicide note.
I like it here.{LF}{LF}I can die alone here.{LF}There's no one to stop me.{LF}I can take things slowly.{LF}{LF}A peaceful, dignified death.{LF}{LF}Life is nothing but misery and suffering.{LF}I'm sick of it.
There's a slip of paper on the ground.{LF}It looks like something's written on it.
Fuyuhi's Note 1
A page from Fuyuhi Himino's diary.{LF}It seems to be about Mt. Hikami.
^00I looked into Mt. Hikami. It's always been a{LF}spiritual place. Not spiritual as in holy, but{LF}spiritual as in filled with the spirits of the dead.{LF}{LF}Maybe that's why it's a suicide spot?{LF}Haruka wouldn't go to die alone, though.{LF}Not without telling me.{LF}^00The books said people get spirited away to{LF}the mountain. They get called towards it and{LF}disappear, alone.{LF}{LF}I read how it calls to people who are perceptive,{LF}anxious, meek and who lack family. My heart{LF}skipped a beat when I read that.{LF}^00It was describing Haruka perfectly.{LF}She's so kind and accepting.{LF}She always opens up to me.{LF}She's alert, even when she seems to be spacing{LF}out.{LF}{LF}She knows what I'm thinking.{LF}{LF}Maybe she was spirited away...{LF}{LF}^00But where do people go when they're spirited{LF}away? The more I think about it, the scarier it{LF}gets, and the more my heart starts pounding.
There's a torn note lying on the ground.{LF}It looks like Fuyuhi Himino's.
Fuyuhi's Note 2
A note written by Fuyuhi Himino.{LF}It's about her missing friend, Haruka Momose.
^00I don't know what to do now that Haruka's gone{LF}missing.{LF}{LF}I can't do anything on my own.{LF}It's like I can't breathe.{LF}{LF}We've been close since we were children.{LF}Now she's gone, I realize how important she is{LF}to me. How irreplaceable.{LF}^00I can't stop thinking I could have done{LF}something when she left that day.{LF}Maybe if I'd said something, I could have{LF}stopped her from going.{LF}{LF}The waiting is unbearable.{LF}{LF}I should have been the one to disappear.{LF}It should be me.{LF}^00If Haruka comes back, there's so much I want to{LF}tell her.{LF}{LF}I should tell her how I really feel, before we end{LF}things together.{LF}{LF}Maybe she's already known for a long time,{LF}but I'll tell her anyway. I have to tell her.
There's a note lying among the dead leaves.{LF}It looks like Fuyuhi Himino's.
Fuyuhi's Note 3
A note found in front of the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}It's about Fuyuhi Himino and Haruka Momose.
^00Haruka and I have been close since{LF}kindergarten.{LF}{LF}We sang a song together at graduation.{LF}It was called "The Song of Memories."{LF}{LF}Haruka and I looked at each other when we sang{LF}together. I'll never forget that.{LF}^00I think about those times a lot lately.{LF}{LF}They were the best.{LF}{LF}If I even hum that tune, I start to tear up.
There's a page from a notebook on the ground.{LF}It looks like Fuyuhi's handwriting.
Deteriorating Note
A note found in the Unfathomable Forest.{LF}It seems to be about seeing a shrine maiden.
^00This place will do. No one will find me here.{LF}This'll be a place just for me.{LF}{LF}I can melt away, bit by bit.{LF}{LF}I'll be like water, seeping into the ground.{LF}I won't be myself anymore.{LF}I'll be one with nature.{LF}^00Was I dreaming just now?{LF}{LF}A woman dressed in white was looking down at{LF}me. She looked like one of those shrine maidens{LF}I've heard about.{LF}{LF}I didn't have the strength to move,{LF}but she kept on watching me.{LF}^00She seemed harmless...{LF}{LF}I came here because I don't like people looking{LF}at me. They're always looking down on me.{LF}{LF}But being watched in my final moments felt{LF}strangely relieving.{LF}{LF}^00{LF}{LF}{LF}{LF}I'm glad I came here.
A faded note found amidst the underbrush.
Unfinished Manuscript
Ren's unfinished manuscript.{LF}It doesn't even have a title yet.
^00Memorial portraiture, the act of photographing{LF}dead bodies, was a practice in Western countries{LF}in the 19th Century, a time when photography{LF}was still a rare and expensive luxury.{LF}{LF}^00The bodies of recently deceased family members{LF}and loved ones were photographed in lifelike{LF}poses, as a solemn keepsake of remembrance.{LF}While researching the phenomenon, I discovered{LF}that a similar custom made its way to Japan,{LF}as well.{LF}{LF}^00Known as "Postmortem Photographs,"{LF}a small number of these photos still remain.{LF}{LF}I have been fortunate enough to obtain one such{LF}photograph, which I found to contain a certain{LF}beauty lacking in its Western counterparts.{LF}^00When photography first arrived in Japan,{LF}it was accompanied by the prevalent superstition{LF}that photographs could steal a person's soul.{LF}{LF}Whether anyone truly believed this or not,{LF}it surely gave Postmortem Photography a special{LF}significance in Japan.{LF}^00If photos were taken with this belief in mind,{LF}then Postmortem Photographs would not simply{LF}have been taken as keepsakes, or for mourning{LF}purposes. Rather, the practice may have carried{LF}a certain deeper spiritual significance.
^00There's an unfinished manuscript on the desk.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00It doesn't yet have a title.{LF}I'll need more materials to solidify the theme.
Hisoka's Letter
A letter regarding a rare, old camera.{LF}It refers to the Camera Obscura as dangerous.
^00To Ren Hojo,{LF}{LF}The camera you left me to look at is a device{LF}known as a Camera Obscura. Its purpose is to{LF}capture images of the supernatural: things{LF}invisible to the naked eye.{LF}{LF}^00These cameras are incredibly rare, with an almost{LF}mythical status in the antiques market.{LF}A few have been known to exist, but this is the{LF}first I've ever seen with compound lenses.{LF}{LF}^00I don't mean to frighten you, but rumor holds{LF}that to own a Camera Obscura is to invite{LF}misfortune. They say everyone who has owned{LF}one has either died, lost their mind, or gone{LF}missing. The cameras themselves have outlived{LF}many owners.{LF}^00While some aficionados do seek them out,{LF}the stories of previous owners meeting with such{LF}misfortune has had an impact on their value as{LF}antiques.{LF}{LF}My Camera Obscura was left to a local family{LF}after its previous owner passed away. They{LF}graciously gave it to me.{LF}^00I believe yours is still usable, but please do{LF}exercise caution in doing so.{LF}{LF}Sincerely, Hisoka Kurosawa{LF}^00P.S. The cover on your Camera Obscura is{LF}broken, but it seems it originally had a box{LF}shape.{LF}{LF}I doubt you'd sell it to me, but I would like to{LF}borrow it for a while if you don't mind. I am{LF}happy to compensate. Please think it over.
It's a reply to the appraisal request for this Camera Obscura.{LF}It urges caution in using it.
The Maiden Slayer
A book about Mt. Hikami folklore.{LF}It refers to the ghosts of shrine maidens and their killer.
^00The Maiden Slayer{LF}{LF}Mt. Hikami has long been steeped in legends{LF}revolving around suicide and ghosts.{LF}{LF}Revered as a sacred place since time immemorial,{LF}it was once the worshipping ground and home{LF}of many shrine maidens.{LF}^00Once, there was a man who fell in love with a{LF}maiden, and came to the mountain in order{LF}to court her. However, she remained loyal to her{LF}duties and refused his advances.{LF}{LF}Enraged, the man killed her and threw her into{LF}the river.{LF}{LF}^00Several days later, he returned with a torch and{LF}blade, and proceeded to brutally butcher all the{LF}shrine maidens on the mountain, tossing them{LF}into the river as he went.{LF}{LF}^00The waters of the mountain flowed red with{LF}blood, carrying the slaughtered corpses of the{LF}maidens all the way down to the{LF}Pool of Purification.{LF}It is said that the eyes of each of the shrine{LF}maidens had been gouged out.{LF}{LF}^00Just before killing the first maiden and tossing{LF}her into the river, the man's eyes met with those{LF}of his victim. Something in her eyes led him to{LF}murder the others, or so the legend goes.{LF}{LF}With all the maidens dead, he killed himself by{LF}cutting his own throat.{LF}^00The ghosts of shrine maidens, still drenched in{LF}those bloodied waters, have appeared on the{LF}mountain ever since.{LF}{LF}It is said that those who meet their eyes are led{LF}to their deaths; they follow the women into the{LF}water and drown themselves.{LF}{LF}^00Though only a legend, the story is believed to be{LF}based on an actual incident.{LF}Local records show that the bodies of several{LF}shrine maidens were discovered long ago,{LF}and that all rituals and rites ceased to be{LF}performed from that day on.
^00I came across this book while researching Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}^00I don't think this story has anything to do with what's going on now,{LF}but you never know.
Rui's Journal 1
Part of Rui's journal, found on the bookshelf.{LF}It mentions finding something through shadow reading.
^00Mr. Hojo can't clean up after himself.{LF}{LF}For someone who's lived alone for so long,{LF}he's incapable of housework. He can't cook and{LF}he's bad at tidying up.{LF}{LF}I'm more like his caretaker than his assistant.{LF}^00He loses things all the time, and whenever he{LF}doesn't have a book he needs, he blows up.{LF}He usually ends up asking Ms. Kurosawa for{LF}help.{LF}{LF}One time when I was trying to sort all his books,{LF}there was one I couldn't find anywhere. It's like{LF}it just disappeared.{LF}^00Ms. Kurosawa found it with her shadow reading.{LF}She went into his room on her own, then came{LF}back out a little while later with the missing{LF}book.{LF}{LF}She just smiled and said something about{LF}making the invisible visible. What is this{LF}shadow reading business, anyway?{LF}^00That reminds me of that one time...{LF}I was tidying up and I came across something I'd{LF}never seen before.{LF}{LF}It was like Ms. Kurosawa said: the invisible{LF}became visible.{LF}{LF}It was kept inside an old box. I don't even know{LF}what it was.{LF}^00I put it aside to sort out later on, but when I{LF}went to take a proper look, it had vanished.{LF}{LF}It must have gone invisible again.
^00This looks like part of Rui's journal.{LF}It must have gotten mixed in here while tidying.{LF}{LF}^00I feel bad reading it, but...
Messy Note 1
This seemed to belong to the innkeeper.{LF}It mentions the view from the observation room.
^00How long has it been since I lost everything?{LF}The mountain swallowed up half my inn. All I{LF}have left is that old album of Postmortem{LF}Photographs... The one left by my father.{LF}{LF}I don't even know who these photos are of,{LF}but it's the last vestige of family I have.{LF}^00How long have I spent here, wallowing in the{LF}darkness?{LF}...It doesn't matter.{LF}{LF}I'll burn it all, and then there will only be me.{LF}{LF}I think I'll end it up in the observation room on{LF}the roof. The sunset is lovely up there.
There's a note lying on the shelf.{LF}Maybe it belonged to someone who lived here.
Messy Note 3
A note dropped by a ghost in the inn.{LF}It mentions Mikomori and the shrine maidens.
^00This place has gone from a tourist hotspot to a{LF}suicide hotspot.{LF}{LF}But I suppose that was always the case.{LF}This mountain and death go together,{LF}side by side.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00Mikomori was once known as the Grove of{LF}Shrine Maidens. A sacred grove where the{LF}mountain's maidens oversaw the deaths of{LF}pilgrims, easing their passing to the other side.{LF}{LF}I like that. I envy it. I wish someone would be{LF}there to see me off.
^00A soiled note has been left here.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00It looks like it was left by the innkeeper.
Suicide Note
A suicide note, probably from the innkeeper.{LF}He claims he was doing the right thing.
{LF}The sunset beckons.{LF}{LF}It's calling me into the water.{LF}{LF}This is the right thing to do.
There's a scrap of notebook paper on the floor.{LF}It looks like there's something written on it.
Messy Note 4
An old note from the third floor of the inn.{LF}It looks like the innkeeper's handwriting.
^00The album of Postmortem Photographs was{LF}assembled by a folklorist who lived on the{LF}mountain.{LF}{LF}His name was Keiji Watarai. He became{LF}fascinated by the custom and moved to{LF}Mt. Hikami to study how it spread through{LF}Japan.{LF}^00My father seemed to take an interest in these{LF}photos as well. Strange foreign customs always{LF}fascinated him.{LF}{LF}While he was running the inn, he helped{LF}Watarai collect Postmortem Photographs{LF}from the nearby town.{LF}{LF}^00On Mt. Hikami, water itself was deified.{LF}{LF}It seems like Watarai wanted to get a deeper{LF}understanding of this unique outlook, so he set{LF}up a house in the forest to experience it{LF}firsthand.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00He was greatly aided by my father, who had{LF}already set up the inn by that point. He{LF}remodeled it from an old, unused shrine. I think{LF}he thought the extra religious heft would help{LF}attract more visitors.{LF}{LF}^00One day, the folklorist went missing. Several{LF}people formed a search party, but they were{LF}unable to find a trace. Even the road to his house{LF}seemed to have been lost to the woods.{LF}^00My father scoured the mountain too, but all he{LF}found was that photo album.{LF}{LF}He was soaking wet when he got back.{LF}I remember he was acting strangely. His eyes{LF}had this curious glint... Almost like he'd been{LF}possessed by something.{LF}{LF}^00The next thing I knew, my father went missing{LF}as well.{LF}I'd forgotten about the photos until I found{LF}them in the old building, after the landslide.{LF}But now I understand why my father left.{LF}Watarai, too.{LF}{LF}These photos are so beautiful.
There's a note here.{LF}It seems to have been singed a little by fire.
Messy Note 2
This seemed to belong to the innkeeper.{LF}It mentions people being spirited away.
^00Even before the landslide, there were always{LF}strange goings-on around here.{LF}{LF}Some years ago, two girls went missing on a{LF}college field trip. The police were stumped.{LF}A few days later, one of the girls turned up{LF}again, seemingly out of her mind.{LF}^00There were lots of theories, but most people{LF}believed they were simply "spirited away."{LF}That girl came back each year to look for her{LF}friend, like some sort of pilgrimage.{LF}{LF}Countless people have gone missing here over{LF}the years. We're all used to it by now.{LF}^00My father was "spirited away" too. As was the{LF}folklorist, Keiji Watarai.{LF}{LF}Next it'll be my turn, I bet. I'll vanish with the{LF}rest of them.{LF}{LF}I doubt anyone will think to come looking for{LF}me.
^00There's a soiled notebook here.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00Like the one found in the old building, it looks like it belonged to{LF}the innkeeper.
Yuri's Report
A report on a shadow reading case written by Yuri.{LF}It's about the album of photographs she found.

A missing person file for one Kazuya Sakaki.{LF}I've heard Hisoka mention the name before.
Hisoka's Journal 1
A journal found in Hisoka's desk drawer.{LF}She's written about a client's feelings.
^00Met with a potential client.{LF}{LF}Doesn't know whether subject is alive or dead.{LF}Says she may have wandered off somewhere.{LF}May be waiting for help...{LF}{LF}Doesn't want to leave home in case subject{LF}comes back on her own.{LF}^00I tripped up...said something I shouldn't have.{LF}I asked what she'd do when we find her. She{LF}laughed and said "When she gets back, there are{LF}things I want to tell her."{LF}{LF}Her smile looked forced. She looked worn down{LF}by it all. I should mind my own business.{LF}^00I'm worried about leaving Yuri alone, but this{LF}one is urgent.{LF}{LF}No time to lose. I have to go.
There was a journal tucked away in the drawer.{LF}It looks like some notes relating to clients.
Miku Hinasaki

Suspect{LF}     subject is alive, but a newer or {LF}     stronger token is required.{LF}{LF}     It may be that the subject does{LF}     not want to be found.
^00Some dusty old paperwork was also under there.{LF}{LF}{LF}^00It looks like a shadow reading request.{LF}"Case Closed" is written in large, red letters.
Is this from when my mother went missing?{LF}Why would Yuri have this?

Haruka's Note 1
A note found on the shrine pathway.{LF}It mentions being unsure of what lies ahead.
{LF}I awoke to the sound of water.{LF}{LF}Should I press on, or go back?{LF}{LF}This is the point of no return.{LF}{LF}If I want to see Fuyuhi again...
There's a note here, soaked in the water.{LF}It's written in small, feminine handwriting.
Haruka's Note 2
A note found in the Pool of Purification.{LF}It mentions watching the sunset.
^00I came here because of the sunset.{LF}It was so beautiful, it made me want to cry.{LF}{LF}It was the same as the sunset I saw{LF}when I survived.{LF}{LF}The sun seemed to sink into the mountain.{LF}I had to come and see it.{LF}^00Melting away into the waters of the mountain{LF}seems natural... It seems right.{LF}{LF}I feel like the others are telling me to.{LF}The ones who didn't survive.{LF}{LF}The sunset is drawing closer.{LF}Or maybe I'm drawn to it.
There's a note lying in the water.{LF}Maybe it's from Haruka.
Haruka's Note 3
A note found outside the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}It mentions going somewhere alone.
Fuyuhi didn't see the sunset.{LF}Only I could see it.{LF}{LF}That's why I have to go alone.{LF}{LF}The light of the setting sun lives on in{LF}the mountain.{LF}{LF}{LF}I wish Fuyuhi could've seen it.
There's a note lying on the collapsed bridge.{LF}Such small handwriting... I think it's Haruka's.
Haruka's Note 4
A note left in the Shrine of Dolls, in tiny writing.{LF}It mentions the "Song of Memories."
^00Ever since we survived, I've felt like every day{LF}could be my last.{LF}{LF}I feel closer to Fuyuhi than ever. It's nice sharing{LF}secrets with her... Sharing my guilt.{LF}{LF}We often talk about the past. I remember a lot{LF}of things from back then...{LF}^00Like how her face was the first picture I drew in{LF}kindergarten. We split the sheet of paper and{LF}drew each other.{LF}{LF}I remember growing taller than her, and how she{LF}stayed at my house while hers was being{LF}renovated. We often talk about that kind of{LF}stuff.{LF}^00Most of all, I remember singing the{LF}Song of Memories at kindergarten graduation.{LF}I looked over at Fuyuhi and she was already{LF}looking at me, waving.{LF}{LF}Whenever I hear that song, it makes me want to{LF}go back there...to that time.{LF}My whole life has been flashing before my eyes.{LF}^00Of all the moments, that's the one I want to{LF}keep on living over and over, forever.
There's a note here written in small writing.{LF}It looks like Haruka must have come here.
Shrine of Dolls 1
A handwritten note found in the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}It's a record from when the shrine was rebuilt.
^00Having sat abandoned for many years,{LF}the Shrine of Dolls has now undergone{LF}significant reconstruction.{LF}{LF}In the past, local legends tell that the shrine used{LF}so-called "effigies" as offerings. These effigies are{LF}likely the old dolls that were found inside.{LF}^00The road to the shrine was improved, and so{LF}the number of visitors gradually increased. There{LF}was no end to the visitors bringing their own{LF}dolls to add to those left outside.{LF}{LF}Assuming this practice to be harmless, no effort{LF}has been made to prevent it.{LF}^00As we were repairing the old dolls, we learned{LF}that each of them is engraved with a name.{LF}{LF}We also found tiny teeth, bones, and small{LF}bundles of hair tucked away inside.{LF}{LF}Were these mere keepsakes, or perhaps{LF}something more?{LF}^00The purpose of the shrine has since become{LF}clear.{LF}{LF}It appears these dolls were believed to contain{LF}the souls of deceased children and were likely{LF}offered to the shrine as some kind of ritual.{LF}{LF}^00We also learned of a cave below the shrine.{LF}Known as the Womb Cavern, it housed several{LF}human remains.{LF}Perhaps initially, it was not dolls offered up at{LF}the shrine, but people. It seems the cavern may{LF}be where the bodies were disposed.{LF}{LF}^00We are considering renovating the cavern into{LF}storage space, placing the bones into dolls of{LF}their own and holding a joint memorial service{LF}for them all.
There's an old document lying in the dresser.{LF}It seems to be a record of something.
Shrine of Dolls 3
A handwritten note found in the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}It's about children playing with dolls.
^00I've been having those dreams again, where I'm{LF}playing with the kids. I've started looking{LF}forward to playing with them. Sometimes I don't{LF}even want to wake up.{LF}{LF}I looked into it, and the games we've been{LF}playing actually used to exist.{LF}^00One is called "Spirited Away."{LF}{LF}Everyone hides each other's dolls and whoever{LF}finds theirs last is "spirited away." That is,{LF}they go out of the game.{LF}{LF}Wooden dolls were usually used, made from the{LF}sticks of trees on the mountain.{LF}^00The next game was called "Ghost Marriage."{LF}{LF}Everyone hides their dolls, except one person,{LF}called the "Outsider." That person then chooses{LF}a partner of the opposite sex and searches for{LF}their doll.{LF}{LF}^00It's a bit like hide-and-seek, only the owner of a{LF}doll that's found is said to be "bound," that is,{LF}married, to the Outsider. However, if the{LF}Outsider finds the wrong doll, then the owner of{LF}that doll becomes the "Outsider" instead.{LF}{LF}^00My theory is that these games are based on{LF}actual rituals that took place on the mountain.{LF}In my dreams, the games go on until the{LF}children disappear into the mist.{LF}{LF}I wonder what would happen if they took me{LF}with them?
There's an old document inside the drawer, covered in a bunch of doll parts.
The Doll Memorial
A document found in the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}It mentions a doll memorial ceremony.
^00I decided to conduct a memorial ritual of{LF}sending a doll downriver, as is described in{LF}Mt. Hikami folklore.{LF}{LF}Here on the mountain, the flowing waters have{LF}long been deified. Life springs from the water,{LF}then returns to it.{LF}{LF}^00All of the bones in the cave beneath the shrine{LF}had been laid into the waters. This was probably{LF}considered to be a way of returning life to the{LF}water.{LF}{LF}{LF}{LF}{LF}^00The shrine was built upon the Pure Water River,{LF}with a walkway crossing it.{LF}{LF}I have found numerous dolls at the bottom of{LF}the river and downstream. These dolls were{LF}likely placed on the water as a form of memorial{LF}for those they depicted.
There's an old notebook left in the hallway.
Bloodstained Note 1
A handwritten note found outside the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}There are spots of what looks like blood on it.
I must kill them all.{LF}{LF}Every shrine maiden.{LF}{LF}I can't stand their eyes.{LF}{LF}I must gouge them out.{LF}{LF}{LF}They have seen too much.
There's an old handwritten note here.{LF}It's covered in black smears.
The Veiled House
Rui's notes on the video entitled "The Veiled House."
^00The diary found at the old inn mentioned a{LF}folklorist who lived on Mt. Hikami. I have found{LF}more information on him, including his name,{LF}in books on the occult.{LF}{LF}^00This folklorist, Keiji Watarai, went to the{LF}mountain due to his obsession with the{LF}mysteries of the sect living there. He then went{LF}missing, as mentioned in the diary, and rumors{LF}about what happened to him abound.{LF}^00They say that he didn't just die or go missing,{LF}but rather he stumbled on something the{LF}mountain wanted kept hidden, and so his entire{LF}house was swallowed up by the mist.{LF}{LF}This is the origin of one of Mt. Hikami's more{LF}recent stories of a haunted house.{LF}^00While the veracity of this is unclear, I looked{LF}into a video tape, left behind by someone who{LF}stumbled across the house. The video is{LF}apparently famous in occult circles.{LF}{LF}I contacted the publisher, and received the{LF}following response.{LF}^00"Dear Rui Kagamiya,{LF}{LF}Thank you for contacting us.{LF}{LF}The video you are looking for is no longer in{LF}print, but there are some copies in our{LF}warehouse. This video prompted a huge amount{LF}of feedback from customers.{LF}^00The tape was found near a river on Mt. Hikami.{LF}It is unknown who filmed it. There were many{LF}sections too damaged by water to be usable, and{LF}so we took what was left and edited it together.{LF}{LF}The master copy of the video was confiscated by{LF}the police. ^00They conducted a search of the{LF}mountain, but were unable to find who shot the{LF}film, or even the house's location.{LF}{LF}Now that entering the Unfathomable Forest is{LF}prohibited, we advise you not look into this on{LF}your own.{LF}{LF}Koji Kakimoto,{LF}Suigensha Film Division"{LF}^00I believe the building visible at the start of the{LF}video is the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}{LF}After that, we see what seems to be a cave, but{LF}it's hard to make anything out.{LF}{LF}From the large number of books seen in the{LF}house, it's likely that it really is the former home{LF}of Keiji Watarai.
It's a report written in Rui's handwriting, along with commentary on{LF}the video.
Rui's Journal 2
Rui's journal, found in Ren's study.{LF}It's about Ren's dreams.
^00Mr. Hojo often cries out in his sleep.{LF}{LF}He won't tell me much, but it seems like he has a{LF}recurring dream, about a ceremony from his{LF}childhood.{LF}{LF}As a young boy, Mr. Hojo said he spent a{LF}summer with relatives at the base of Mt. Kagiroi.{LF}^00He's mentioned playing in an old house and in{LF}a shrine on the mountain, and some kind of{LF}festival he went to. Mr. Hojo doesn't talk about{LF}his past much, so what he has told me I{LF}remember clearly.{LF}{LF}Is he dreaming of that ceremony? I went to{LF}festivals as a child, but all I remember is{LF}having a good time.{LF}^00It doesn't sound like the festival Mr. Hojo{LF}dreams about is any fun.{LF}{LF}He often cries "Don't look at me!" in his sleep.{LF}{LF}He's always had a hard time with people staring{LF}at him. He especially dislikes it when women look{LF}at him for too long.{LF}^00He won't even look Ms. Kurosawa or{LF}Miss Kozukata in the eye sometimes.{LF}{LF}He doesn't have that issue with me, though.{LF}{LF}Are the women he's dreaming about really that{LF}frightening?
^00These look like notes of Rui's.{LF}Maybe she dropped them.{LF}I wonder if it's OK to read this...
Rui's Journal 3
Rui's notes, found at the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}It mentions Ren acting strangely.
^00Mr. Hojo has started acting strangely. It's like{LF}his mind is completely elsewhere.{LF}{LF}This all started when he saw that photo.{LF}He's usually on the lazy side, but now he's{LF}obsessed with tracking down these photos. {LF}{LF}^00I have to go with him, if only to make sure he{LF}doesn't wander off willy-nilly.{LF}{LF}Would he put this much effort into searching for{LF}me if I went missing, I wonder?
Rui's notebook has fallen on the floor.{LF}Maybe it has some clues.
Shrine of Dolls 2
A notebook found in the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}A priest has written about his dreams.
^00The children are playing. Sometimes I wake up{LF}at night, feeling their presence. The following{LF}morning, dolls that I know I've put away have{LF}moved someplace else.{LF}{LF}The more this happens, the more clearly I hear{LF}the sounds of playing, and the more often I have{LF}dreams where I'm there among the children,{LF}playing with them.{LF}^00I can't make out the children clearly, but I think{LF}my late daughter is one of them.{LF}{LF}Last night, it felt like I was being watched.{LF}I awoke to find a white-haired girl staring at me.{LF}{LF}She said, "Don't worry. Your daughter is playing{LF}with the doll you fixed." After that, she{LF}disappeared.{LF}^00Those eyes... It's like she could see everything.{LF}She even seemed to answer the very question{LF}that was on my mind.
There's a soiled notebook lying in the hallway.{LF}Maybe it belonged to a priest who lived here.
Shrine of Dolls 4
A notebook found in the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}It mentions a dream with a reliquary and a girl.
^00Today's dream was stifling.{LF}{LF}It was night, and several men carrying burning{LF}flames spent a long time exploring the area{LF}underneath the main shrine.{LF}{LF}They carried a huge reliquary underground,{LF}burying it where no one would ever find it.{LF}^00That white-haired girl was sleeping inside the{LF}box.{LF}{LF}She was waiting for someone, but it wasn't me.{LF}I didn't have what she wanted. At least, I felt like{LF}I didn't.{LF}{LF}I remember feeling so incredibly sad when I{LF}woke up.
There's a soiled notebook lying in the hallway.{LF}Maybe it belonged to a priest who lived here.
Folklorist's Notes 1
Notes written by Keiji Watarai, the folklorist.{LF}He explains why he came to Mt. Hikami.
^00There is a peculiar custom in this country.{LF}It varies from region to region, but the root{LF}is the same. It is mysterious, yet somehow{LF}beautiful.{LF}{LF}In order to understand it, I traveled across the{LF}country before settling on this mountain.{LF}^00The beauty of the morning dew, the palpable{LF}heartbreak of the sun setting behind the{LF}mountain, and the grave and solemn night that{LF}envelops it.{LF}{LF}On the mountain, water itself is revered.{LF}But why? To try and understand this, I have{LF}made this mountain my home.
There was an old notebook lying on the shelf.{LF}It's written in very elegant handwriting.
Folklorist's Notes 2
Notes written by Keiji Watarai, the folklorist.{LF}They mention seeing a shrine maiden in the mist.
^00I saw the silhouette of a shrine maiden from{LF}within the mist that envelops the mountain.{LF}{LF}With great care, she made her way slowly up{LF}the mountain.{LF}{LF}Something about her seemed somehow...{LF}unnatural.{LF}{LF}^00I've been told there are no more shrine maidens{LF}on the mountain now.{LF}{LF}Long ago, many maidens were murdered here.{LF}Perhaps they returned to the water?{LF}{LF}Would that then imply they are trapped within{LF}the mist?
There was an old notebook lying on the stack of books.{LF}It's written in elegant handwriting.
Folklorist's Notes 3
Notes written by Keiji Watarai, the folklorist.{LF}They're about Postmortem Photography.
^00Postmortem Photography made its way over{LF}from the west along with the spread of the{LF}camera.{LF}{LF}When photography was still rare, images of{LF}the deceased helped the surviving family{LF}members deal with their grief.{LF}{LF}^00The Postmortem Photographs that still exist in{LF}Japan used the same methodology as their{LF}western counterparts, but the significance{LF}seemed to differ.{LF}{LF}Those taken here in the Mt. Hikami region,{LF}especially, seem to embody a certain melancholic{LF}beauty.{LF}^00I believe these photos were the work of a{LF}scientist named Kunihiko Aso. Having{LF}researched photos from other areas as well, it{LF}seems he was the one behind many of them.{LF}{LF}^00His surviving records indicate a determination to{LF}use photography to "capture the soul."{LF}Seeing these strange and captivating{LF}photographs, I've come to believe he had some{LF}degree of success in doing so.{LF}{LF}^00An old friend of mine used to call cameras{LF}"lonely boxes."{LF}I'm not sure if he meant that the subject appears{LF}trapped alone in this dark box when viewed{LF}through the viewfinder, or that looking through{LF}the viewfinder meant peering out through the{LF}dark, all alone.{LF}{LF}^00At any rate, I find those words have a certain{LF}resonance.
There was an old notebook on the bookshelf.{LF}It seems to be about Postmortem Photography.
Folklorist's Notes 4
Notes written by Keiji Watarai, the folklorist.{LF}They talk about death on the mountain.
^00The waters of this mountain are beautiful.{LF}A large volume of water flows from a lake at{LF}the summit, becoming rivers and waterfalls and{LF}enveloping the mountain in mist. Water covers{LF}everything; it is the source of this mountain's{LF}beauty, as well as its sense of mystery.{LF}^00According to local tradition, Mt. Hikami is{LF}where one could die a "proper" death.{LF}{LF}It has long been considered a spiritual spot,{LF}and the subject of much worship, making it a{LF}righteous destination for those seeking death.{LF}{LF}^00The Mt. Hikami sect taught that, upon dying,{LF}people "return" to water.{LF}{LF}Here on the mountain, water is considered the{LF}source of the soul. A person's soul is then said to{LF}return to water upon death, rather than moving{LF}on to an afterlife.{LF}^00Those ready for death would gather at the{LF}mountain and return their lives to the water.{LF}{LF}Water connects everything.{LF}{LF}To look at this scenery, I can understand how it{LF}has become a spiritual place: a place fit for{LF}passing from this world.{LF}^00I'm glad I came here.{LF}{LF}The people on this mountain have a yearning for{LF}death. That is to say, they have a yearning for{LF}water, and a yearning for nature.{LF}{LF}Life and death are both connected to water.
There was an old notebook on the bookshelf.{LF}It seems to be about death on the mountain.
Folklorist's Notes 5
A notebook found in the folklorist's house.{LF}It seems to be about human sacrifices.
^00It is said that human sacrifice was once practiced{LF}throughout this region.{LF}{LF}Rather than returning people to the water upon{LF}death, the ritual involved placing so-called{LF}"Pillars" in special reliquaries and sending them{LF}to the water while still alive.{LF}^00It was the role of shrine maidens to become such{LF}Pillars. They would take on the memories of the{LF}dying, and thereafter return to water themselves.{LF}{LF}In doing so, it was believed the subjects would{LF}continue living on as Pillars.{LF}^00In Japan, there was once a sect of Buddhist{LF}monks who would inter themselves in boxes{LF}buried underground for the sake of{LF}enlightenment. These monks were said to show{LF}they were still alive by ringing bells and{LF}chanting.{LF}{LF}This practice may be related.{LF}^00But what did the maidens who became Pillars{LF}fear, or hope to appease?{LF}{LF}There are various teachings in Japan about where{LF}the afterlife, also known as the Netherworld or{LF}the hereafter, is located.{LF}{LF}Some teachings say it is above the mountains or{LF}across the sea, where others claim it lies{LF}underground, within the very earth itself.{LF}^00Here on the mountain, it is said to lie within the{LF}water, implying a close link between water and{LF}death.{LF}{LF}The Pillars within the reliquaries would be in a{LF}place close to death, but would go on living.{LF}{LF}^00Perhaps it was the special reliquaries that allowed{LF}them to evade death and continue living, frozen{LF}in time.{LF}It is thought that perpetuating these Pillars{LF}allowed those close to death to live longer lives.{LF}{LF}In a sense, it was believed that proximity to{LF}death helped develop a resistance to it.
The notebook on this desk has no dust on it.{LF}It's as if someone was just writing in it.
Folklorist's Notes 6
A notebook found in the folklorist's house.{LF}He's written about Kunihiko Aso.
^00Mt. Hikami seems to have been both revered and{LF}feared as a "mountain of death," where only{LF}those prepared to die may enter, and those who{LF}visited were never allowed to leave.{LF}{LF}^00Visitors to the mountain had to pass through{LF}the shrine grove at the foot of the mountain,{LF}where shrine maidens kept strict watch in{LF}allowing only the qualified - that is, the dying -{LF}to enter.{LF}^00Today, the shrine at this grove has been rebuilt{LF}as an inn, whose innkeeper kindly let me borrow{LF}records of the time period.{LF}{LF}The records from the shrine's final year list one{LF}individual who was able to leave the mountain{LF}alive.{LF}^00Kunihiko Aso{LF}{LF}After taking his Postmortem Photographs, it{LF}seems he was invited to the mountain to{LF}photograph the maidens.{LF}{LF}I have heard his research into the hereafter{LF}allowed him to develop a special camera.{LF}^00If I could see these photos of the shrine maidens{LF}taken with this special camera, I'm certain I{LF}could come closer to unraveling the mysteries of{LF}Mt. Hikami.{LF}{LF}^00When invited to the mountain, it is said he was{LF}allowed into a house visited only by a select few{LF}individuals.{LF}If I were invited to the mountain, would I be{LF}able to reach this place, too?{LF}{LF}I truly wish I could.
This looks like a notebook of the folklorist's.{LF}Could that ghost just now have been...?
Folklorist's Notes 7
Notes written by Keiji Watarai, the folklorist.{LF}He talks about finding a photograph.
^00On the way to the summit, I found a photo on a{LF}small path lined with spider lilies.{LF}{LF}The path seemed to head into the forest, but it{LF}has become overgrown and is unpassable.{LF}{LF}Could it lead to that mansion, that only the{LF}invited can find?{LF}^00It is different from other Postmortem{LF}Photographs.{LF}{LF}I can only describe it as being beautiful.{LF}{LF}It had a beauty and a sadness unlike the others{LF}I've seen.{LF}{LF}Was she alive?{LF}^00As soon as I thought how beautiful she was,{LF}I was bound. I heard whispers of love from{LF}the photograph. They were the words of a curse.{LF}{LF}Love after death.{LF}I must go to that place.{LF}{LF}My heart has been captivated.
There's a note lying where that ghost was...
Note from Miu
A note found inside the cable car.{LF}She's written about her mother leaving.
^00My mother left when I was three years old.{LF}{LF}I barely remember her. She hugged me, and then{LF}she disappeared into the sunset.{LF}{LF}There was nothing I could do.{LF}{LF}I cried, staring at the sunset.{LF}^00Why did I just watch her go?{LF}Why did I let her go?{LF}{LF}I can't just wait for her.{LF}I have to go.{LF}{LF}There are things I want to tell her when I see{LF}her.
It isn't very dirty. In fact, it seems newly written.{LF}Maybe Miu left this here.
Writings on Glancing
Writings found at the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}They're about "glancing."
^00    A shrine maiden's glance allows her to see{LF}    the hearts of those returning to the water.{LF}{LF}      The maidens take their pain, their sins,{LF}    and all their secrets, to ease their passing.{LF}{LF}   Maidens whose hearts are full are made into{LF}                            Pillars.{LF}^00  Those secrets taken on by the shrine maidens{LF} are sealed in the reliquaries with them, that they{LF}     might never find their way back outside.
^00There's an old text atop the writing desk.{LF}^00I can make out the word "glance."
The Immortal Flower
Old writings found in front of an altar inside the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}They're about the Immortal Flower.
^00    Those who are to be Pillars are placed into{LF}         reliquaries filled with Black Water.{LF}{LF}     The maiden lays within the Black Water.{LF}       This is not death but an eternal sleep.{LF}{LF}       She shall not age, but stay as she was,{LF}                   an Immortal Flower.{LF}^00  Sleeping in the Black Water brings dreams of{LF}               death, endlessly repeating.{LF}{LF} When the maiden can stand no more, her body{LF}     dissolves, and her role as a Pillar is ended.{LF}{LF}         Only the strongest maidens become{LF}                   an Immortal Flower.{LF}^00  Via this eternal suffering we become eternal.{LF}{LF}             Such is our role in appeasing{LF}                    the Shadowspring.
^00There is an old text on the floor by the altar.{LF}^00It appears to be about the "Immortal Flower."
Mt. Hikami's Strictures
An old text dropped at the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}It's about Mt. Hikami's strictures.
^00  The Shadowspring, source of the Black Water.{LF}{LF}  To contain the Shadowspring, to prevent that{LF}  Black Water from bursting forth, Mt. Hikami{LF}       must be bolstered with the reliquaries.{LF}{LF}^00Maidens cross from the Shrine of the Ephemeral{LF}    to the Shrine on the Water on the Boat of{LF}       Passage, to become the Great Pillars.{LF}{LF}       Caskets are used so as to not taint the{LF}mountain's soil. Reliquaries are used to protect{LF}                the purity of the water.{LF}{LF}^00   The waters of Mt. Hikami are the source of{LF}                            the soul.{LF}{LF}         The Pure Water must be protected.{LF}     The Black Water must not be allowed to{LF}                          overflow.
^00I found some old papers with writing on them.{LF}^00They seem to be about Mt. Hikami's strictures.
Tainted Waters
An old text left on the flooded floor.{LF}It's about something being tainted.
^00      The Black Water must not be allowed to{LF}                            overflow.{LF}{LF}    The Black Water is the Netherworld itself.{LF}{LF}  Should the Pure Water ever be tainted by the{LF}    Black Water, a calamity shall surely occur.{LF}^00       The world of the living shall become{LF}                     the Netherworld.{LF}{LF}The souls of man shall rot, and those who would{LF}       return to water shall become the dead.{LF}{LF}     The Black Water must not be allowed to{LF}                              overflow.
^00I found some old papers with writing on them.{LF}^00They seem to be about something being "tainted."
The Shadow-touched
An old text dropped in the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}It mentions the "Shadow-touched."
^00              Touch not the Black Water.{LF}{LF}   To immerse in such darkness is to melt and{LF}                            rot away.{LF}{LF} Only those who wish for death can endure such{LF}                             agony.{LF}^00  We Shadow-touched are all bound for death.{LF}{LF}We shall carry the reliquaries and submerge them{LF}        in the Black Water until we too have{LF}                            rotted away.{LF}{LF}      The Black Water must not be allowed to{LF}                              overflow.
^00An old text left beneath the lattice window.{LF}^00I can make out the word "Shadow-touched."
Cave-in Record
A record of the tunnel cave-in.{LF}It talks about the relief efforts after the accident.
^00This makes three landslides. It's blocked off the{LF}tunnel, trapping 18 workers inside.{LF}{LF}Reports say that this time the wall on the{LF}summit side collapsed, bringing in water which{LF}caused further damage.{LF}{LF}There must be a flooded cave.{LF}^00We've found the survivors, but given the risk of{LF}further injury rescue efforts have been{LF}suspended.{LF}{LF}Water is still rushing out, making any rescue{LF}attempt inordinately difficult.{LF}^00We are waiting for the deluge to stop before{LF}attempting aid. We've recovered 13 bodies.{LF}Something has left the corpses black and rotting,{LF}like they're melting or something.{LF}{LF}We've searched almost all of the tunnel, but still{LF}haven't found those last five bodies.{LF}^00We found a hole inside that looks like it was dug{LF}from the inside by hand. It appears to connect to{LF}the caverns.{LF}{LF}Though it's unlikely, we're going to continue the{LF}search to see if anyone escaped into the caves.{LF}^00A number of black boxes were discovered in the{LF}caves. Their lids are shut tight, and they can't be{LF}opened. They seem to be filled with water.{LF}{LF}They may be anthropologically significant, so we{LF}need permission to move them before{LF}continuing our search.{LF}^00There are repeated reports of spotting a woman{LF}in a white kimono inside the cavern.{LF}{LF}^00Amongst the search party, several of those{LF}involved in moving the black boxes have had{LF}their hands or other body parts turn black, and{LF}started to show signs of necrosis. We are{LF}advising against touching the boxes.{LF}{LF}Three people are missing.{LF}^00We found the body of the search party leader,{LF}as well as two workers caught in the cave-in,{LF}in Mikomori Pond.{LF}{LF}Their bones are all broken, and they exhibit the{LF}same black corrosion as the others.{LF}^00With the death of the search party leader, the{LF}search has been called off.{LF}{LF}There are growing rumors of a "curse," so the{LF}workers seem relieved.{LF}{LF}^00Construction has officially been abandoned.{LF}We're blocking off the site.
^00What appears to be a report is inside this damp, string-tie file folder.{LF}^00It's a record on what happened during the tunnel cave-in.

Hisoka's Journal 2
This is Hisoka's journal, found in the Forbidden Valley.{LF}She's talks about someone's whereabouts.
Beyond the Forbidden Valley is the sacred{LF}ground at the summit. The Twilit Peak, and{LF}the Lake of the Departed.{LF}{LF}If she has the ability, it's possible she was led{LF}there.{LF}{LF}Or perhaps I'm the one who's being called to{LF}that place.
^00Hisoka's journal has been left here.{LF}^00It appears she came this way after all.
Black Diary 1
Old notes found amongst a pile of reliquaries on the Twilit Peak.{LF}They talk about the "Great Pillar."
We must forge more Pillars.{LF}{LF}The Great Pillar is collapsing.{LF}{LF}The Black Water will overflow.{LF}The Black Water must be contained before{LF}the Great Pillar melts away.
A journal with a black cover has been left here.{LF}Did it belong to that old woman?
Water-design Journal 1
A journal with a white cover and a flowing water pattern.{LF}It's about becoming a shrine maiden.
^00I became a shrine maiden after I survived that{LF}flood.{LF}{LF}I was half-dead when I awoke, alone amongst{LF}the corpses.{LF}{LF}I could see things. Things that no one else could{LF}see.{LF}{LF}That was my calling.{LF}^00I purified my body, and when I arrived at{LF}the mountain, I was overwhelmed with a{LF}cacophony of voices.{LF}{LF}The talking trees, the whispering stones,{LF}the weeping water.{LF}{LF}Echoes of past prayers piled up one on top of{LF}another.{LF}^00Time slowed to a crawl, and I could see each{LF}individual raindrop that fell.{LF}{LF}The veins on every leaf stood out vividly.{LF}{LF}Images of death flashed in front of me. I could{LF}smell the choking stench of death.{LF}^00I was told I would need more training.{LF}{LF}I wanted to flee as soon as I arrived, but I had{LF}no home to run away to.{LF}{LF}No matter where I go, it will be the same.{LF}In the end, I will be alone.
^00Another journal has been left in the same place.{LF}^00It has been written in beautiful handwriting.
The Rear Shrine
An old text found at a shrine on the Twilit Peak.{LF}It's about the Rear Shrine of Dolls.
^00   The lost orphaned children are called by the{LF}                      sunset to climb{LF}{LF}     called by the sun as it sets in the realm of{LF}  the dead, crossing over into the Netherworld{LF}{LF}       So that they might cross over into the{LF}  Netherworld as they come together and play{LF}{LF}              we honor them with effigies
It's titled "The Rear Shrine."{LF}This must be what the shrine was dedicated to.
Local Customs
It's a book about old customs from this region.{LF}It talks about something called "Mikomori."
^00"Mikomori"{LF}In the area around Mt. Hikami there is a custom{LF}of receiving water from the mountain.{LF}The people call it "Mikomori," and it is placed in{LF}casks to bring into their homes, used only for{LF}special ceremonies.{LF}{LF}^00It is used to give a newborn its first bath, or to{LF}cleanse the bodies of the dead.{LF}{LF}This stems from the belief that the soul comes{LF}from the water, and returns to it in death.{LF}^00Another use for this water is known as the{LF}"cry of the mountain."{LF}{LF}According to an old woman in the village, there{LF}is a saying:{LF}{LF}"When Hikami lets out a cry, one must wash in{LF}Mikomori."{LF}^00When Mt. Hikami "cries out," or rumbles, one{LF}ritually immerses oneself or otherwise wets{LF}oneself with the water.{LF}{LF}The custom likely comes from the mountain's{LF}sound being a bad omen, and they use the{LF}Pure Water as a sort of ward.{LF}^00"But when the water dries, your daughters may{LF}be gone. Do not go in search when the{LF}mountain is awake."{LF}{LF}This must refer to girls being taken to the{LF}mountain after the ward has worn off, an{LF}explanation for the number of girls going{LF}missing in the area.
^00I found a book titled "Local Customs."{LF}^00It seems to be about the customs in the area around Mt. Hikami.
Tales of Photography
It's a book of introductory anecdotes passed down in the Mikomori region.
^00The Mikomori region has many anecdotes{LF}regarding the act of photographing the dead.{LF}{LF}Many are simple superstitions, but some allow us{LF}a glimpse into the customs of another time.{LF}{LF}These stories show both great understanding,{LF}and great fear.{LF}^00"Vanishing"{LF}{LF}A man showed a photograph to a friend.{LF}{LF}The picture showed the faint silhouette of a{LF}person.{LF}{LF}Upon seeing the silhouette, the man cried out{LF}and ran, leaving the photo where it was.{LF}^00Each time the man looked at the photo, the{LF}silhouette grew more and more distinct.{LF}{LF}It was his friend.{LF}{LF}It is said that his friend disappeared after that.{LF}^00"The Photo Bride"{LF}{LF}A local fool suddenly declared that he had{LF}married.{LF}{LF}The village threw a celebration but no one had{LF}seen the bride.{LF}{LF}Someone went to man's house, and could hear{LF}the sounds of a woman talking within.{LF}^00However, looking inside he saw only the man{LF}from behind, with no sign of a woman.{LF}{LF}Days pass, and the man hasn't left his house,{LF}so one of the villagers went to check on him.{LF}There was no one in the house; only an old{LF}photograph left behind.{LF}^00In the photo was a bride hiding her face, and the{LF}missing man was at her side.{LF}{LF}The man who saw the photo said the bride{LF}appeared to be smiling.
It's a book about local folk anecdotes.
Yuri's Notebook 1
A notebook that was left atop Yuri's desk.{LF}She's written about the things she sees.
^00When my heart gets weak, I can't even breathe.{LF}It takes all my strength just to breathe.{LF}{LF}All I can do is take the breath, and then hope to{LF}take another.{LF}{LF}I grow exhausted and spend all my strength just{LF}to live, I am aware of death, and I see.{LF}^00People whispering.{LF}People with broken faces.{LF}People with ruined bodies.{LF}People who stare at me from bloody sockets.{LF}People crying endlessly.{LF}{LF}All I can do is close my eyes, cover my ears,{LF}and wait for the moment to pass.{LF}^00They are always watching me.{LF}{LF}They say I don't belong here.{LF}{LF}It should have gotten better.{LF}{LF}I should have gotten better.
Yuri's notebook. It seems she's written in it like a diary.
The Ghost Marriage
A book about the "Ghost Marriage" ceremony.{LF}It was written by the folklorist, Keiji Watarai.
^00The custom of marrying the dead is seen{LF}elsewhere too, but the "Ghost Marriage" of{LF}Mt. Hikami was unique.{LF}{LF}Rather than being done to mourn the dead,{LF}the Ghost Marriage seems to have been part of a{LF}ritual in which shrine maidens were sacrificed.{LF}^00Similar traditions join the dead with an{LF}imaginary spouse depicted in votive pictures.{LF}{LF}However, on Mt. Hikami it seems living men{LF}were brought in to be bound to the maidens.{LF}{LF}Once on the mountain, the men were not{LF}allowed to leave.{LF}^00The Ghost Marriage brought in "Outsiders" to{LF}soothe the soul of the shrine maiden, and to{LF}strengthen the Pillar she had become.{LF}{LF}Unable to leave the mountain, the shrine{LF}maidens would wait for a man to come and die{LF}with them.
^00This book was written by the folklorist, Keiji Watarai.{LF}Maybe it can shed some light.
The Female Perspective
A book about the traditions of Mt. Hikami's shrine maidens.{LF}It's by Keiji Watarai.
^00The shrine maidens of Mt. Hikami were tasked{LF}with leading pilgrims to death.{LF}{LF}They were feared, and people thought a maiden's{LF}glance stripped away the soul.{LF}{LF}Tales of ghost shrine maidens are common on{LF}Mt. Hikami.{LF}^00My research into Japanese folklore has{LF}led me to believe that an underlying fear of{LF}women permeates this very culture.{LF}{LF}But who were the shrine maidens?{LF}{LF}As women who immersed themselves in water{LF}and led people to their deaths,{LF}the shrine maidens of Mt. Hikami call to mind{LF}tales of bewitching sirens.{LF}^00The traditions of Mt. Hikami came to an end in{LF}an incident where the shrine maidens were all{LF}murdered.{LF}{LF}The incident was most likely spurred on by this{LF}fear the locals had of the shrine maidens.
^00This appears to be a book by folklorist Keiji Watarai about shrine maidens.{LF}^00Maybe there's something in here about the maidens of Mt. Hikami.
Tales of the Sunset
A book about folk stories of the sunset.{LF}It looks like it was written by the folklorist Keiji Watarai.
^00Mt. Hikami's name is thought to mean{LF}"mountain that climbs higher than the sun."{LF}{LF}Some posit that it was once written in a way{LF}that means "mountain of the sun gods," but that{LF}is far from certain.{LF}{LF}What is certain is that many tales{LF}about the sunset still persist to this day.{LF}^00"People must only climb the mountain{LF}as the sun is setting."{LF}{LF}This likely comes from a local ceremony where{LF}those going to the mountain to greet their{LF}deaths would go at sunset, when the{LF}Netherworld was said to be closest to ours. {LF}^00"One mustn't look at the mountain at sunset."{LF}"You must stay inside when the mountain cries."{LF}{LF}The "Dark Sun" was a god of misfortune and{LF}calamity.{LF}{LF}The setting sun over Mt. Hikami was said to be{LF}an omen of this "Dark Sun," drawing people in{LF}to their doom.{LF}^00As for the "cry," tremors are also often seen{LF}as a portent of calamity.{LF}{LF}On Mt. Hikami it was thought that it was{LF}the water rumbling, and it is said that{LF}if you could hear it, you were eligible{LF}to become a shrine maiden.{LF}{LF}Other sources say that locals washed in special{LF}water when these tremors happened.
^00This is a book by the folklorist, Keiji Watarai.{LF}^00Mt. Hikami's sunsets, the rumbling...{LF}Maybe there's some clue in here.
Drenched Note
A note left on a bed in the shop. It says how "everyone will end"{LF}in small handwriting.
^00Once the sunset reaches here, the end won't be{LF}far off.{LF}{LF}After that, the mountain will let out a mighty{LF}roar, and everything will overflow.{LF}{LF}It will overflow, and everyone will end together.{LF}It'll be good. It'll be over.{LF}^00Since it'll be over, I came to see everyone.{LF}{LF}So that we can die properly before the end{LF}comes.
There's a wet note left atop the bed.
Rui's Journal 4
Rui's journal, found at the folklorist's house.{LF}It talks about a change in relationship.
^00Mr. Hojo is captivated by the woman in that{LF}photograph.{LF}{LF}He's never been good with women.{LF}{LF}But, he's starting to change.{LF}{LF}I can't do anything about it, he's changing.{LF}^00I’d like to keep things between us{LF}just as they are.{LF}{LF}The relationship we have now.{LF}{LF}I like the ambiguity.{LF}{LF}But, he's going to decide sooner or later.{LF}{LF}I wonder, which way will he choose?
Rui's notes have fallen on the floor. What could this mean?
Note from Miku 1
A note dropped at a dead end in the Forbidden Valley. It says "I have to go."
{LF}  I have to go.{LF}{LF}  I'm so sorry.{LF}{LF}  Forgive me.
There's a scrap of paper on the ground.{LF}Did my mother leave this?
Black Diary 2
Notes dropped amongst the reliquaries on the Twilit Peak.{LF}They talk about the Pillars.
^00There are two boxes for shrine maidens.{LF}{LF}Those who will be Pillars are to be placed in{LF}reliquaries. The pain of having their limbs{LF}crushed gives them strength.{LF}{LF}Those who can be stronger Pillars are placed in{LF}caskets.{LF}^00Through the Ghost Marriage, Pillars can last{LF}even longer.{LF}{LF}The caskets are made large enough to also{LF}accommodate the groom she is joined to.{LF}{LF}To protect the casket, guardians shall be{LF}submerged around it.
An old book with a black cover has been dropped on the ground.
Water-design Journal 2
A journal with a white cover and a water pattern.{LF}It talks about the "Great Pillar crumbling."
^00Another shrine maiden goes to{LF}the Shrine of the Ephemeral to become a Pillar.{LF}{LF}The Black Water is restless. During the Witching{LF}Hour, the mountain lets out a shriek.{LF}{LF}The Funeral Celebrant laments that the{LF}Great Pillar will soon succumb.{LF}^00The Wedding Celebrant is hurriedly making{LF}votives.{LF}{LF}The Ghost Marriages have begun.{LF}{LF}Maidens cannot be joined while in the mortal{LF}world. Only Pillars can enter into{LF}Ghost Marriages.{LF}^00Perhaps this Ghost Marriage is meant to console{LF}maidens alone in their caskets.{LF}{LF}Since surviving that flood, I've thought I would{LF}live alone and that I would die alone.{LF}{LF}Perhaps here on Mt. Hikami, that can be{LF}changed.
^00Another journal has been left in the same place.{LF}^00It's written in beautiful handwriting.
On Flamekeepers
An old text that was on the fire altar in the hut that appeared in the{LF}Unfathomable Forest.
^00       The Forbidden Flame mustn't go out.{LF}  It purifies water and drives back the darkness.{LF}{LF} The Forbidden Flame fends off the Black Water,{LF}   and only those who hold the flame can stand{LF}                     the Shadowspring.{LF}{LF}         The Forbidden Flame must remain.
An old text has been left atop a burning altar.{LF}It seems to be about being a Flamekeeper.
Shiragiku's Journal 1
A journal with a red cover and a white chrysanthemum pattern.{LF}It must belong to the girl who was at the Shrine of Dolls.
^00Until I am seven, I am with the gods. I am{LF}unborn. When I turn seven, I will be human.{LF}{LF}That's why I will become a Pillar before I turn{LF}seven.{LF}{LF}I am not long for this life, but if I become a{LF}Pillar I will not die, I will be an Immortal{LF}Flower.{LF}^00I will go on forever, undying.{LF}{LF}But will I be alone forever?
A journal with a white chrysanthemum emblem.{LF}This belongs to the white-haired girl.
Rui's Journal 5
Rui's journal, left at the folklorist's house.{LF}She's written about "waiting."
Mr. Hojo came for me once before.{LF}{LF}He'll come for me again.{LF}{LF}I'm waiting.{LF}I will keep waiting.{LF}{LF}Waiting is all I can do.
I found one of Rui's journals.{LF}Seems she came here after all.
Folklorist's Notes 8
These notes appear to be those of Keiji Watarai, the folklorist.{LF}He's written about some calamity.
^00The old texts found at the shrines tell of a{LF}disaster.{LF}{LF}The waters, tainted and black, flowed down the{LF}waterfalls, sullying the pools, and became a{LF}black mist that enveloped the mountain. The sun{LF}turned a muddy crimson. The border between{LF}worlds blurred.{LF}^00Now, the waters are clear, and the mists are{LF}white.{LF}{LF}It is unknown whether this disaster actually{LF}happened, or whether it was passed down as a{LF}mere cautionary tale.{LF}{LF}If it really did occur, what must the locals have{LF}thought?{LF}^00Did the mountain rumble, appearing shrouded{LF}in black shadows? Did the rivers look like long{LF}strands of black hair? Did people see the{LF}Black Water running down the paths? The truth{LF}is unclear.{LF}{LF}What is clear is that the waters now are clean{LF}and pure.
I found an old notebook atop the desk.
Kazuya's Note 3
The note was dropped by that ghost that looked like Kazuya.{LF}It's blackened and damp.
^00It was over the moment I saw that photograph.{LF}I'm done for.{LF}{LF}The moment I fixed my eyes on that lonely face,{LF}I bound myself to her. I know that if I change{LF}my mind, I'm dead.{LF}{LF}I've been chosen to be her groom.{LF}^00I have to go now.{LF}{LF}She's been waiting for so long.{LF}{LF}She's waiting just ahead.{LF}{LF}But not for me.{LF}{LF}She's waiting for another.
These notes are crumpled and heavily damaged.{LF}There's something written here.
On Choosing a Bride
An old text that was in the big, abandoned mansion.{LF}It talks about choosing a bride.
^00     Grooms are brought in from other places.{LF}{LF}          The groom makes his choice from{LF}                    illustrated votives.{LF}{LF}  The Wedding Celebrant calls upon the chosen{LF}    Immortal Flower, and the two are brought{LF}                           together.{LF}^00 The Immortal Flowers are waiting for someone{LF}             to join them in their caskets.{LF}{LF}         All they can do is wait for a partner.{LF}                   They cannot choose.{LF}{LF}      That is the Immortal Flowers' final wish.
An old text was left on the floor.
On Bridehood
An old text that was hidden in the large mansion's storeroom.{LF}It talks of Ghost Marriage.
^00     The bride chosen has an audience with her{LF}                             groom.{LF}{LF}   If the man can look on the Black Water with{LF}     unwavering resolve, the Ghost Marriage is{LF}                           successful.{LF}{LF}     If it fails, he shall be placed in a separate{LF}                          reliquary.{LF}^00The bride will be returned to her casket alone to{LF}            wait anew for another selection.
I found an old document. I can make out the words "Ghost Marriage."
Regarding Bridegrooms
An old document that was dropped in the large mansion's banquet hall.{LF}It talks of bridegrooms.
^00The bridegroom's soul, after the Ghost Marriage,{LF}  is bound with the bride and placed with her in{LF} the casket, so that the Pillar can remain strong.{LF}{LF}  The votive of the wedding is finished, and the{LF}       groom's soulless body is interred in the{LF}                     Forbidden Valley.{LF}^00        The souls of men driven mad by the{LF}    Ghost Marriage are enshrined in unmarked{LF}          graves in the Forbidden Valley.{LF}{LF}   The corpse is placed in a reliquary alone and{LF}   interred in the depths of the Womb Cavern.
An old text left at the seat of honor in the banquet hall.{LF}I can make out "bridegroom"...
Dr. Aso's Records 1
Handwritten notes left in the room with the peephole.{LF}They talk of Postmortem Photographs.
^00As photography is still so expensive, it's common{LF}to dress the deceased up for Postmortem{LF}Photographs.{LF}{LF}Upon seeing those pictures, I decided to make a{LF}camera.{LF}{LF}Postmortem Photographs are more than simple{LF}mementos.{LF}^00They capture death and the soul in a way the eye{LF}can't.{LF}{LF}I devoted myself completely to making a camera{LF}that could capture what we can't see.{LF}{LF}As soon as I had a working prototype I began{LF}taking Postmortem Photographs.{LF}^00I traveled the country, taking photographs of{LF}dead bodies.{LF}{LF}People were thankful to have the subjects' spirits{LF}preserved.{LF}{LF}The people in Tamai, Ayukawa and Katase, near{LF}Mt. Hikami, were particularly elated. They said{LF}they were "like the Pillars."{LF}^00But this is still not the camera I was after.{LF}It still only captures visible light.{LF}{LF}I have to capture what the eye cannot,{LF}the portion composed of "shadows."{LF}{LF}If I do, perhaps I can prove the existence of an{LF}invisible world.
^00An old book with a blue cover has fallen on the floor.{LF}^00The name "Kunihiko Aso" is on the spine. This must have been left by{LF}Dr. Aso, inventor of the Camera Obscura.
Bloodstained Note 2
A handwritten note that was on the fire altar in the hut that appeared.{LF}It is stained with blood.
This mountain must end.{LF}{LF}You must take it with you.{LF}{LF}Do not leave it behind.{LF}{LF}Do not allow it to linger.
An old text has been left by the fire altar.{LF}I can see black stains in several places.
Kazuya's Note 1
A part of what seems to be Kazuya's notes.{LF}He's written about the coming wedding ceremony.
^00I don't know where I am, or how I got here.{LF}{LF}The last thing I remember is calling him on the{LF}phone.{LF}{LF}Maybe if he could have stopped me,{LF}I wouldn't have ended up here.{LF}^00The ceremony will start soon.{LF}{LF}This is the end.
^00New-looking notes have been dropped here.{LF}^00I recognize the handwriting. It's Kazuya's.
Kazuya's Note 2
A note that was dropped in the shadow{LF}of the partition screen in the hallway.
^00I'm so scared, I can't stop shaking.{LF}{LF}I have to go.{LF}{LF}I chose her, so we have to die together.{LF}{LF}She's been waiting for so long.
^00Notes have been dropped in the shadow of the partition screen.{LF}^00Something has been written in shaky handwriting.
The Black Reliquaries
An old text found in the hut that appeared in the Unfathomable Forest.{LF}It talks about reliquaries.
^00      The reliquaries protect the maidens from{LF}                       the Black Water.{LF}{LF}    They are filled with the Black Water, and a {LF}                    maiden is shut inside.{LF}{LF}     The maiden becomes a Pillar, protecting{LF}                     the Pure Water.{LF}{LF}^00      The reliquaries prevent the Pillar from{LF}   melting away, keeping her within the water.{LF}{LF}  They must not be opened before the Pillar has{LF}	             crumbled.{LF}{LF}    The only one who can open the reliquary is{LF}                       the one inside.
There was an old text lying on the floor.{LF}It mentions reliquaries and Black Water.
Yuri's Notebook 2
A notebook that was left on Yuri's desk.{LF}She's written about hearing voices.
^00When did I realize I could see things that others{LF}could not? When did I realize I could hear the{LF}voices of dead people?{LF}{LF}They tell me things. They whisper to me, the{LF}same things over and over.{LF}^00I have to cover my ears so that I don't{LF}accidentally listen.{LF}{LF}If I listen to them, I'll know. And if I know,{LF}I'll accept it.{LF}{LF}Many, many, many voices, all talking to me.{LF}{LF}It doesn't make any sense.{LF}^00If only I could stop them from whispering to{LF}me.
A notebook has been left on the desk.{LF}This looks like Yuri's diary.
Hisoka's Journal 3
Notes that were left on Hisoka's desk.{LF}She's written about her feelings towards Yuri.
^00I never did learn why Akari went missing.{LF}{LF}I guess she took that secret to the grave. It may{LF}seem trivial to other people, but it must have{LF}been important to her.{LF}{LF}Maybe people really can't understand one{LF}another.{LF}^00I managed to save Yuri.{LF}{LF}I don't know why she went missing, though.{LF}When I touch her, I see nothing.{LF}{LF}Maybe there was no reason. And that worries{LF}me, like peering through darkness.{LF}^00Yuri will leave someday.{LF}{LF}It's OK if I don't know why.{LF}{LF}It's OK if we don't really understand each other.{LF}{LF}As long as she is in my arms, Yuri will be here{LF}with me.
A small notebook has been left on the desk.{LF}It looks like Ms. Kurosawa's journal.
Note from Miku 2
This was left outside the mansion deep in the Forbidden Valley.
^00I was abandoned.{LF}{LF}Four years ago, Miu came into my life.{LF}{LF}But now, I have to leave her.{LF}{LF}I don't have long left. I can feel that the end is{LF}close.{LF}^00Everyone dies alone. But, I don't want to be{LF}alone.{LF}{LF}I have learned of a thing called Ghost Marriage.
There's a scrap of paper on the ground.{LF}Did my mother leave this?
Note from Miku 3
This scrap of paper was left on a dresser in the mansion deep in the{LF}Forbidden Valley.
^00I have to go now.{LF}{LF}I could always see things no one else could see.{LF}Only Mafuyu understood me.{LF}{LF}I could never tell him how I feel, though.{LF}He left before I could tell him.{LF}^00I could never look him in the eye.{LF}{LF}He'd have known how I feel if I let myself look{LF}at him like that.{LF}{LF}It was difficult being with him, but it was better{LF}than being alone.{LF}^00He doesn't need to understand me. I don't need{LF}to be with him forever.{LF}{LF}If I can just ease my brother's suffering for a{LF}moment as he keeps the gates of the underworld{LF}sealed.{LF}^00In the end, who will be by my side?{LF}{LF}Let me do this, please.{LF}{LF}Forgive me.
^00There's a scrap of paper by the dresser.{LF}^00Was she here...? Did my mother leave this?
White Diary
A small notebook left by the old woman in the white kimono.{LF}It talks about waiting for "Aso."
^00The Ghost Marriage allows Pillars to persist{LF}longer.{LF}{LF}Maidens who become Pillars must be bound to{LF}someone.{LF}{LF}Sad though it may be, no maiden can endure the{LF}pain they suffer within the reliquary on her own.{LF}^00We brought many men to wed Ose, but they all{LF}had a change of heart; the joinings failed. I feel{LF}she might be waiting for Master Aso to come{LF}back to her.{LF}{LF}^00But even if he does come, there is no guarantee{LF}that she will be the one he chooses.{LF}{LF}They may have made a promise, but we know{LF}that Outsiders have fickle hearts.
A book with a white cover...{LF}Did that old woman write this?
Note from Ren
This note appears to be from Ren.{LF}He's written about a recurring dream.
^00I had that dream again.{LF}{LF}The one where I swing that knife down on a girl{LF}in a ceremony.{LF}{LF}Before I bring down the knife our eyes meet.{LF}When they do, I feel a jolt of fear like she's seen{LF}into my soul. The girl then falls into a box.{LF}^00Did it really happen?{LF}{LF}If it was real, then what happened to that girl?{LF}{LF}When I woke up, my pulse was pounding. I am{LF}beset with overwhelming regret, pain, and{LF}sadness.{LF}^00The ceremony must be from that summer when{LF}I was a boy, when I stayed with the Aso family{LF}on Mt. Kagiroi.{LF}{LF}I'd play with the local children all over the place,{LF}even on the grounds of Kagiroi Shrine until the{LF}sun set. I think that's when it must have started.{LF}^00I've been thinking about going back to{LF}Mt. Kagiroi for some time now.{LF}{LF}But, I'm scared of learning the truth about{LF}that dream.{LF}{LF}I hear it's all been demolished. Maybe there's{LF}nothing left to tell me if it's a dream or not.
A notebook has been left on the floor.{LF}Did it belong to the person staying in this room?
Hisoka's Journal 4
A small notebook that was left in Hisoka's room.{LF}It talks about people having secrets.
^00Everyone has secrets. Secrets they never tell{LF}anyone. Secrets that cannot be shared.{LF}{LF}When people go missing, they take those secrets{LF}with them. Maybe it's the weight of those secrets{LF}that drives them to disappear. They must want to{LF}escape the heavy burden.{LF}^00Someday, Yuri may learn of my secrets,{LF}my scars.{LF}{LF}But then we might finally be able to open up to{LF}each other.{LF}{LF}Maybe I'll be able to face this, head-on,{LF}and make a fresh start.
A notebook that has fallen next to the bed.{LF}Is this Hisoka's journal?
Shrine on the Water
It's an old text about Mt. Hikami.{LF}It talks about the Shrine on the Water and its traditions.
^00Oral tradition tells us of the{LF}"Shrine on the Water."{LF}{LF}It is said to be the source of life, and home to{LF}the sun god.{LF}{LF}People summoned by the cry of the mountain{LF}are said to pass through the shrine on their way{LF}to the gods.{LF}^00There are claims of people offering up their{LF}thoughts and their souls to release them from{LF}their suffering.{LF}{LF}The shrine appears in several folktales, but{LF}unfortunately no trace of the building itself has{LF}ever been found.{LF}^00The question is, where is this shrine located?{LF}Could it lie on top of a literal body of water,{LF}as the name suggests?{LF}{LF}The Lake of the Departed on the summit is{LF}always covered in mist. {LF}{LF}The silhouette of a torii gate can be seen when{LF}the sun sets.{LF}^00If that is the Shrine on the Water, it is likely{LF}that only certain individuals - those granted{LF}special permission - were allowed to approach{LF}it via boat.
An old text about the Shrine on the Water that was left on a bookshelf.
Dedication
This old text was left on the altar with the hanging lanterns in{LF}the Shrine of the Ephemeral.
^00The Shrine of the Ephemeral houses three Pillars{LF}       who guard the mountain's Pure Water.{LF}{LF}                  One for the caskets.{LF}            One for the Forbidden Flame.{LF}                  One for the water.{LF}{LF}         The water passes through the Shrine,{LF}                   purified by the flame.{LF}^00 To proceed, one must receive permission from{LF}                      two maidens.{LF}{LF}   With the two keys, receive the blessing of the{LF}                 maidens on the water.
It mentions the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}It seems to be about why it was built.
The Three Pillars
An old text left at the statue clutching its knees at{LF}the Shrine of the Ephemeral.
^00  Once, the Black Water flowed forth, but three{LF}      strong Pillars threw themselves in, and{LF}             the Shadowspring was sated.{LF}{LF}     The three Pillars eventually succumbed to{LF}                        the darkness.{LF}{LF}                They live on as statues,{LF}           in the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}^00  The three Pillars collapsed, and five more took{LF} their place. All of Mt. Hikami became a barrier;{LF}     one the Black Water could not overcome.{LF}{LF} So long as Mt. Hikami stands, the Black Water{LF}               shall never again overflow.
An old text was left in front of the statue clutching its knees.
The Taboo of Glancing
An old text left at the altar beneath the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}It talks about "glancing."
^00        To glance into someone is to take on{LF}             their thoughts, their secrets. {LF}{LF} The weak do so with a touch; while the strong{LF}        can do it with a look, a true glance.{LF}{LF}                   Howsoever it is done,{LF}                the result shall be the same.{LF}^00          This power is of the Netherworld.{LF}{LF}  By drenching oneself in the mountain's waters,{LF}      the heart melts, and joins with the water,{LF}          strengthening the one who glances. {LF}{LF}    Getting closer to death also brings strength,{LF}       allowing one to take on more thoughts,{LF}                          more secrets.{LF}^00    Strong thoughts make for stronger Pillars.{LF}{LF}   The thoughts are sealed with the Pillar inside{LF}                        the reliquary.{LF}{LF}To open the box and let these thoughts overflow{LF}       is to invite disaster, and is forbidden.
An old text has been left on the altar.{LF}I can make out the word "glance."
Water-design Journal 3
An old book marked with a flowing water pattern.{LF}It talks about the powers of the shrine maidens.
^00Through training, shrine maidens approach{LF}death.{LF}{LF}The closer they get, the more they lose{LF}themselves. But the maiden must keep strong.{LF}{LF}By getting closer to death, it is possible to know{LF}everything.{LF}^00This is how we are able to glance people's{LF}thoughts.{LF}{LF}We all leave behind powerful echoes of our self,{LF}and as long as these echoes remain a soul cannot{LF}move on.{LF}{LF}A shrine maiden must help the soul pass to{LF}the Netherworld.{LF}^00They must take on those final thoughts.{LF}Resonate with them, and continue to embrace{LF}them.{LF}{LF}This is the shrine maidens' true role.
It's a white book with a water design.
Water-design Journal 4
An old book marked with a flowing water pattern.{LF}It talks about being chosen to be the Great Pillar.
^00I have been chosen to be the Great Pillar.{LF}{LF}This is such an honor. A girl from a tiny village{LF}becoming the Great Pillar.{LF}{LF}The other maidens wept. They wouldn't stop{LF}crying, so I had to console them.{LF}^00I will be the Great Pillar. They gave me the name{LF}"Kurosawa."{LF}{LF}From now on, I shall be called Ose Kurosawa.
It's a white book with a water design.{LF}This must have belonged to that bride.
Opening Reliquaries
Old writings found in the room with the open reliquary.{LF}They talk about the qualities required to be put in a reliquary.
 Those without the power shall not be placed in{LF}                          reliquaries.{LF}{LF}If one who is weak is placed inside, they will not{LF}survive the pain of the Black Water and enter the{LF}                        Netherworld.{LF}{LF}  Those tainted souls shall not be given a proper{LF}                              death.
An old text was left on the darkened floor.
On the Mountain's Cry
An old text left in the Shrine of the Ephemeral.{LF}It talks about the "cry of the mountain."
^00    Maidens in the Black Water, in reliquaries,{LF}                            as Pillars.{LF}{LF}  The maidens sleep as Pillars, neither alive nor{LF}     dead, reliving the pain of others in a cycle{LF}                             unending.{LF}{LF}The stronger the Pillar, the greater the pain they{LF}                              endure.{LF}^00    When the pain is too much the box opens,{LF}     and the Pillar melts into the Black Water.{LF}{LF}            This weakens the ward against{LF}the Shadowspring, and so the mountain cries out{LF}                              in pain.{LF}{LF}       A cry as of the maidens' pain, a sign of{LF}                     calamities to come.
An old text was left on a crumbling bookshelf.
Hisoka's Journal 5
A small notebook that was in Hisoka's room.{LF}She talks about not being able to save "Akari."
^00I couldn't make it. Just as I thought I had her,{LF}she fell. Akari. I couldn't save her.{LF}{LF}"Forgive me." Those words still echo in my{LF}mind.{LF}{LF}Maybe in chasing after Akari, I pushed her too{LF}far.{LF}^00"I'm so relieved." "Thank you."{LF}The forced niceties made it so much harder.{LF}{LF}After that call, I cried so much I thought I might{LF}die.{LF}{LF}She slipped through my fingers.{LF}I feel like Yuri will, too.
This notebook looks like it's Hisoka's.{LF}Maybe there's some kind of clue in it.
Yuri's Notebook 3
A notebook that was left atop Yuri's desk.{LF}She's written about when Hisoka saved her.
^00The words "I won't let you" brought me back to{LF}my senses. They overwhelmed me.{LF}{LF}The words were so powerful, so absolute.{LF}They really got to me.{LF}{LF}But what really got me to stick around was{LF}something small.{LF}^00Hisoka's favorite words.{LF}"Sometimes a cup of coffee can make all the {LF}difference."{LF}{LF}It was such a little thing, but I never noticed it.
This looks like Yuri's diary.{LF}Maybe there're some clues in it?
In the Reliquaries
This book was left on the counter after Kazuya disappeared.{LF}It looks like it's by Keiji Watarai.
^00The "black boxes" found on Mt. Hikami were{LF}filled with life, with death, and with fear.{LF}In short, they were filled with human sacrifices.{LF}{LF}Shrine maidens were put in these reliquaries to{LF}protect the locals by appeasing the{LF}"Shadowspring."{LF}^00This "Shadowspring" served as a bridge to the{LF}Netherworld.{LF}{LF}In other words, beneath the water, the source of{LF}all life, exists the underworld.{LF}{LF}The "Black Water" came from the underworld{LF}itself and with it came disaster and ruin.{LF}^00The border between life and death was faint in{LF}that place.{LF}{LF}The shrine maidens were said to take on the{LF}memories of people who came to die.{LF}{LF}This seems to be similar to the spirit channeling{LF}seen in other parts of the country.{LF}^00To take on the memories of the dying is to share{LF}in death.{LF}{LF}The maidens glanced people's souls as they died,{LF}taking their secrets as they were sealed in the{LF}reliquaries. The shrine maidens became one with{LF}the water to connect with the people they{LF}glanced.{LF}^00The shrine maidens ferried people to their death,{LF}via the water.{LF}{LF}The maidens of Mt. Hikami presided over death,{LF}but this may have been in effort to protect those{LF}still living.
This book seems to be about reliquaries.
On the Shadowborn
This book was in the storeroom Miu was sleeping in.{LF}It talks about the "Shadowborn."
^00Where Ghost Marriages take place, tales of{LF}children of the dead are often found.{LF}{LF}They are known as "Shadowborn" or "Children{LF}of the Underworld," and are feared by the{LF}people.{LF}^00"The Shadowborn"{LF}{LF}Once, a man beloved by a girl living in a small{LF}village went missing in the mountains.{LF}{LF}Every day, the girl went to the mountain shrine{LF}to pray for his return, but years went by, and the{LF}man never came back.{LF}^00After ten years, the girl had lost her mind. She{LF}went on living and talking to a man who wasn't{LF}there.{LF}{LF}One day, the villagers noticed that she was with{LF}child.{LF}{LF}She said that the man who had gone missing was{LF}the father.{LF}^00Ignoring the talk in the village about the identity{LF}of the father, she gave birth alone.{LF}{LF}The baby girl that was born had the missing{LF}man's eyes.{LF}{LF}As for the man, he was an outsider who had{LF}stumbled upon the village. It later transpired{LF}he was killed by the villagers ten years prior.{LF}^00When the child learned how to speak, she asked{LF}the villagers,{LF}{LF}"Why did you kill my father?"
I found an old book about "Shadowborn."
Ghost Brides
A book by the folklorist Keiji Watarai.{LF}It talks about the "Ghost Marriage" ceremonies.
^00Maidens within the caskets suffer through an{LF}eternal cycle of life and death as they slowly{LF}melt into the water.{LF}{LF}To protect the mountain, the shrine maidens{LF}must endure that pain and suffering alone.{LF}{LF}Until they can take no more.{LF}^00There is a ceremony to soothe the suffering of{LF}the maidens' souls, allowing the Pillar to persist{LF}longer.{LF}{LF}This is the "Ghost Marriage."{LF}^00Living men are brought to the mountain as{LF}grooms for the suffering shrine maidens.{LF}{LF}They choose their maiden, and then exchange{LF}their vows.{LF}{LF}At the moment their souls join, her soul is said{LF}to return to this world.{LF}^00The maiden is then placed back into her casket,{LF}groom in tow, so that she can continue to{LF}uphold the border between life and death.{LF}{LF}Until a maiden is bound by Ghost Marriage,{LF}she is alone.{LF}{LF}She must wait to be chosen.{LF}^00This ritual invokes emotions that transcend life{LF}and death. Perhaps this is part of the{LF}deep-rooted beliefs of this region, where{LF}nature is both feared and revered by the{LF}people.
^00An old book has fallen on the floor.{LF}^00I can see the words "Ghost Marriage."{LF}It looks like it's by the folklorist, Keiji Watarai.
Rui's Journal 6
A notebook that Rui dropped while sleeping.{LF}It talks about needing to choose someone.
^00This might be the end. My body is growing{LF}colder and my blood runs clear, like water.{LF}{LF}My body shakes with the mountain.{LF}I can't move.{LF}{LF}I wanted Mr. Hojo to get away at least,{LF}but he can't escape. He has become an Outsider.{LF}^00He must choose.{LF}{LF}The one he doesn't choose will be thrown away.{LF}I don't think Mr. Hojo will be able to do it.{LF}But it's already too late.{LF}{LF}He needs to choose someone.{LF}He needs to end it with someone.
Rui must've been writing this before going to bed.
Water & Mt. Hikami
A book about Mt. Hikami's fixation on water.{LF}It was written by the folklorist, Keiji Watarai.
^00Water has been deified on Mt. Hikami for{LF}centuries.{LF}{LF}The water from the Lake of the Departed{LF}envelops the mountain in mist.{LF}{LF}To the locals the water is the source of the soul,{LF}and where the soul returns to in death.{LF}^00This belief likely spread due to water being tied{LF}to everything within the wet and humid climate.{LF}{LF}The people fear nature, revere it, and live among{LF}it.{LF}{LF}This may show the true character of the locals.
Was Rui reading this before she went to sleep?
Water, Life, and Death
A book that fell under Yuri's bed.{LF}It talks about the Mt. Hikami locals' ideas on life and death.
^00The beliefs of Mt. Hikami are related to beliefs{LF}found all over the country.{LF}{LF}The water is life, and in death the soul must{LF}return there.{LF}{LF}People came to the mountain to "return" their{LF}souls to the mother that gave it to them.{LF}^00To "die a proper death."{LF}{LF}The belief that dying in the mountain's water{LF}was somehow "proper."{LF}{LF}This shows a strong yearning for nature itself,{LF}with death as just another part thereof.
There's a book underneath the bed.
Yuri's Notebook 4
A notebook that was in Yuri's room.{LF}She's written about a dream involving a shrine maiden.
^00I dreamt of a shrine maiden. Of becoming a{LF}shrine maiden. She lifted her blindfold and{LF}glanced at a dying man, then covered her eyes{LF}and wept.{LF}{LF}I didn't cry.{LF}{LF}I didn't even cry when Hisoka stopped me from{LF}jumping.{LF}^00Hisoka cried, though.{LF}{LF}I wonder when I last cried?{LF}{LF}As a child I used to cry at the sunset.{LF}{LF}Now when I see the sunset I just stare,{LF}transfixed. It feels like I'm melting away,{LF}being called away to the other side.
^00It's my diary. The doctor at the hospital said I should keep one.{LF}^00That I should record my thoughts, dreams, things I could see and hear,{LF}and write them down to read later after I'd calmed down.{LF}^00In the end, he still didn't believe me.
Hisoka's Journal 6
A small notebook that was in Hisoka's room.{LF}She's written about a dream she had.
^00I dreamt of a river. It was the river of death, and{LF}we had to cross it.{LF}{LF}Everyone fought the current, until one by one,{LF}they grew weary and were swept away. I couldn't{LF}save them. In the end I was swept away, alone.{LF}^00Everyone was fighting against the current,{LF}moving as one.{LF}{LF}I felt relieved that we were all connected.{LF}Then I woke up.{LF}{LF}^00When I touched Yuri on that cliff, I saw her{LF}anguish.{LF}{LF}Her survivor's guilt. Her fixation with death,{LF}and her hesitation to chase it.{LF}{LF}Maybe I'm drawn to Yuri, and she to me,{LF}because we are both fighting against the current.
It's Hisoka's journal...
The Shadowspring Tale
A book that was left on the store counter at some point.{LF}It's about a folktale from Mt. Hikami.
^00They say on Mt. Hikami:{LF}{LF}"The Shadowspring is here,{LF}{LF}but it is on the other side."{LF}{LF}It is a curious saying. It must mean that the{LF}spring is both of this world and yet not of this{LF}world.{LF}^00The Black Water flows from the Shadowspring.{LF}Within it lies the underworld itself.{LF}{LF}For centuries the shrine maidens have protected{LF}the Shadowspring, believing it to be a bridge{LF}between worlds.{LF}{LF}Tales abound of such bridges.{LF}^00Are there people all over the country protecting{LF}these bridges as Mt. Hikami does, by drowning{LF}shrine maidens?{LF}{LF}Perhaps Ose Kurosawa, the last{LF}Immortal Flower, was one such sacrifice.
It's a book about an old legend.{LF}It looks like it was written by the folklorist, Keiji Watarai.
Water-design Journal 5
A journal with a white cover and a flowing water pattern.{LF}It seems to be about "glancing."
^00At first the glance is done with a touch, or an{LF}embrace. By the end, thoughts can be taken unto{LF}oneself with a look.{LF}{LF}All people have secrets.{LF}{LF}Being glanced allows them to return to the water{LF}in peace. Without secrets, or suffering.{LF}^00I can see you as well.{LF}{LF}You are fixated with death.{LF}You are afraid of being alone.{LF}{LF}I shall embrace you.{LF}{LF}Come to me.
That woman, the shrine maiden... She's calling to me...
Water-design Journal 6
A journal with a white cover and a flowing water pattern.{LF}It talks about glancing shrine maidens.
^00             Whenever a Pillar crumbles, {LF}{LF}           whenever a shrine maiden falls,{LF}{LF}           the rest of us, bound by water,{LF}{LF}            must take on those emotions.{LF}{LF}           I have glanced so many deaths,{LF}^00              the pain is overflowing.{LF}          The final thoughts of the dead{LF}{LF}              whirl like a maelstrom.{LF}{LF}            I cannot handle any more.{LF}{LF}          My heart has reached its limit.
She's taken the Boat of Passage... to the Shrine on the Water...
Water-design Journal 9
A journal with a white cover and a flowing water pattern.{LF}It talks about becoming a Pillar.
^00I wasn't sure when I should go, but now I know.{LF}I always had to go someday, but one must decide{LF}on one's own in order to become a strong Pillar.{LF}{LF}I will be a Pillar. I will enter the casket. In the{LF}unending solitude I will continue to hold on to{LF}the pain I glanced.{LF}^00I will become the undying, an Immortal Flower.{LF}I shall fall through the Black Water for eternity.{LF}Such is my duty.{LF}{LF}All the death, all the secrets.{LF}{LF}But who is willing to glance the secrets of a{LF}shrine maiden, the secrets that I hold?
She's further inside...waiting...
Rui's Journal 7
Rui's journal was on the sofa in the study.{LF}It talks about wanting to be with someone.
^00Mr. Hojo won't choose me.{LF}I can't do anything about that.{LF}{LF}But I'm fine. I'm fine with it.{LF}{LF}The more I say that, the more I want to cry.{LF}The tears wash me clean. Clean of my clingy{LF}possessiveness, my jealousy, my desire to give in{LF}to him.{LF}^00He doesn't have to choose me.{LF}{LF}I just want to be at his side for as long as he'll{LF}let me.{LF}{LF}He'll grow so used to me there I'll become{LF}invisible to him.{LF}{LF}Like water. I will vanish. I will become{LF}transparent, colorless.
It's Rui's journal. Something's written in it.
Book Next to the Hair
A book that was in a box of the late Dr. Aso's effects.{LF}It tells of a token received from a girl.
^00How long has it been since I found it?{LF}{LF}That ceremony. Was it real? If not, then what is{LF}this hair?{LF}{LF}My memories are hazy. I was caught up in the{LF}passion of the ceremony. I brought down the{LF}blade. Then, darkness.{LF}^00I made a promise to find that girl and bring her{LF}this token.{LF}{LF}I feel like she's still waiting, even though it's{LF}been longer than I care to think about.{LF}{LF}Even at my age--no, because of my age--that{LF}innocent promise we made weighs heavily{LF}on me.{LF}^00A forgotten promise, one that cannot be{LF}unmade.{LF}{LF}Where can I possibly take this token that the{LF}promise might be fulfilled?
^00There was a notebook underneath the bundle of hair.{LF}^00Was this...the original owner of the box... Did Dr. Aso write this?
Dr. Aso's Records 2
Handwritten notes left by Dr. Aso.{LF}They talk about when he came to the mountain.
^00The shrine maiden's grove.{LF}{LF}I received a special invitation to visit this{LF}mountain, where only people who return to the{LF}water are allowed to go.{LF}{LF}The mountain whence none return alive. This{LF}mountain has a unique custom.{LF}^00They believe water to be holy.{LF}The people here yearn for a proper death.{LF}{LF}People come here, chanting about wanting to be{LF}the water.{LF}{LF}They are so sincere, I think I am starting to{LF}believe them.{LF}^00So many people with the same belief. If this is{LF}carried on through the generations, perhaps their{LF}prayers will be answered.
^00These look like Dr. Aso's notes.{LF}^00Are they from when he visited the mountain?
Dr. Aso's Records 3
Handwritten notes left by Dr. Aso.{LF}They talk about the waters flowing down the mountain.
^00The air is so clean here.{LF}{LF}Calm, pure water flows. And the mist is full of{LF}vital energy.{LF}{LF}Everything here has an aura. In the woods, one{LF}can feel not only the animals and trees; the water{LF}itself has an energy.{LF}^00I understand now. The water is alive. "We are{LF}born from water and to water we return."{LF}"The water connects us all."{LF}{LF}Perhaps the shrine maidens with their{LF}well-honed senses perceive this aura, and lead{LF}the people to a proper death.{LF}{LF}Here, in this place,{LF}I am not alone.
In the past, Dr. Aso visited the mountain and took photographs...
Dr. Aso's Records 4
Handwritten notes left by Dr. Aso.{LF}They talk about spending time on "Mt. Kagiroi."
^00This mountain reminds me of the time I spent{LF}on Mt. Kagiroi in my youth.{LF}{LF}Back then, I believed without a doubt in an{LF}invisible world. When did I stop? And why?{LF}{LF}This mountain air has awoken a long-forgotten{LF}memory.{LF}^00I was dozing under a tree, and dreamt of that{LF}ceremony.{LF}{LF}I received something that day in my dream, in{LF}my past.{LF}{LF}Was it a dream? Or did it really happen?
What did Dr. Aso see here on the mountain?
Shiragiku's Journal 2
A handwritten journal left in the Shrine of Dolls by that girl.{LF}It talks about playing hide-and-seek.
^00I'm not like the others. My hair and eyes make{LF}me special. I was told I wouldn't live long.{LF}{LF}That I wouldn't even live to be seven years old.{LF}{LF}They all hid from me, like they might catch{LF}something. Only he didn't run.{LF}^00When we played hide-and-seek, we hid together{LF}in our secret place. Nobody could find us there.{LF}Why did we ever leave?{LF}{LF}The first time I cried was when I had to leave{LF}that place.{LF}{LF}The ceremony is tomorrow.
This journal... Did that white-haired girl leave this?
Shiragiku's Journal 3
A handwritten journal left in the Shrine of Dolls by that girl.{LF}It talks about exchanging vows.
^00At the ceremony on Mt. Kagiroi I cut a lock of{LF}my hair as a token. And as a farewell.{LF}{LF}I fell once. I thought I was dead, but I wasn't.{LF}I survived.{LF}{LF}When I opened my eyes, he was there. I am here{LF}because of him.{LF}That's why I chose him.{LF}{LF}^00On Mt. Kagiroi, girls chosen to be Pillars can{LF}pick their partner.{LF}{LF}I will be placed in a box and be taken to the{LF}mountain. We will exchange vows, be bound{LF}together for eternity.
^00That girl left this journal here.{LF}^00Does she have some connection to Dr. Aso?
Dr. Aso's Records 5
Handwritten notes left by Dr. Aso.{LF}They talk about his thoughts on the "world unseen."
^00A mountain whence none return alive. I shall{LF}surely never see such beauty again.{LF}{LF}Must I die alone?{LF}{LF}When a person dies, do they just disappear? I do{LF}not believe so. I believe they simply move on, to{LF}a world unseen.{LF}^00Here they talk of such a place.{LF}{LF}A world invisible to the human eye.{LF}The Netherworld.
What did Dr. Aso feel here on the mountain?
Dr. Aso's Records 6
Handwritten notes left by Dr. Aso.{LF}They talk about his thoughts on the afterlife.
^00What happens to a person's thoughts after they{LF}die?{LF}{LF}If the soul truly exists, where then does it go? {LF}{LF}To the other world?{LF}That world which we cannot see?{LF}^00What if we could perceive that place, that{LF}Netherworld.{LF}{LF}What if we could capture an image of the soul{LF}itself.
What's Dr. Aso trying to say here?
Dr. Aso's Records 7
Handwritten notes left by Dr. Aso.{LF}They talk about dying alone.
^00I feel I shall die alone.{LF}{LF}Death is a solitary pursuit.{LF}{LF}Here, on the mountain, they don't believe in{LF}dying alone.{LF}{LF}They believe that dying as a couple, in a {LF}Ghost Marriage, can transcend that.{LF}^00They do not die together; the man follows after,{LF}vowing an eternal bond. It is a unique form of{LF}double suicide.{LF}{LF}I can't keep myself from thinking about it.{LF}{LF}I shall likely be thinking about "double suicide"{LF}even as I die.
Dr. Aso... It sounds like he had some regrets in the end.
Water-design Journal 7
A journal with a white cover and a flowing water pattern.{LF}It's about meeting "him."
            Why did he have to show up?{LF}             I'd finally made my decision.{LF}{LF}           He'll never come back for me.{LF}                I cried when he left me.{LF}           I cried until I couldn't breathe.{LF}            I cried until I thought I might{LF}                melt away into nothing.{LF}{LF}              Those words are a curse.
^00Did the bride in the white kimono leave this journal?{LF}^00She's waiting for someone to visit her, too.
Water-design Journal 8
A journal with a white cover and a flowing water pattern.{LF}It's about touching "him."
^00I knew as soon as we touched.{LF}{LF}He was worried that he would live and die alone.{LF}{LF}When I survived, all alone, I thought the same{LF}thing. I can't imagine a greater pain.{LF}^00I wanted to tell him he wouldn't die alone.{LF}{LF}Here on the mountain, we are all one within{LF}the water.{LF}{LF}But I felt that, if I said that, he would know my{LF}deepest desire.
A small notebook has been placed on a cushion.
Shiragiku's Journal 4
A journal with a red cover and a white chrysanthemum pattern.{LF}It talks about a token.
^00On Mt. Kagiroi, the Pillar chooses her partner.{LF}{LF}I chose him.{LF}{LF}I gave him my token, my soul.{LF}{LF}He took my soul with him, and he will bring it{LF}back.{LF}^00{LF}{LF}{LF}We can hide, together.{LF}{LF}In that confining darkness, together,{LF}just like before.{LF}{LF}^00{LF}{LF}{LF}{LF}He will come for me.
This must be the white-haired girl's journal.{LF}Has she been waiting all this time as well?
Bloodstained Note 3
A small handwritten note dropped by the Man with a Blade.{LF}It's blackened and burnt.
^00They're all dead.{LF}{LF}I am alone at last.{LF}{LF}I cannot die a proper death.{LF}{LF}But that doesn't matter.{LF}{LF}That one thing is mine.{LF}It is mine alone.{LF}^00I crushed them all.{LF}{LF}I took back what they saw, what they stole from{LF}me.{LF}{LF}Now there is no one left to see what I am,{LF}what I've done.{LF}{LF}I can die.
