^00Fuyuhi took her own life, and Rui attempted suicide.{LF}The ghost of a shrine maiden appeared on both occasions.{LF}^00Yuri spoke of a black box that she found Haruka trapped in.{LF}^00Does the key to all these events lie in the mountain's dark past?{LF}^00A folklorist, Keiji Watarai, used to live there.{LF}His notes may shed some light on this mystery.
^00The video tape Rui found is on the desk.{LF}It seems to be related to that folklorist.{LF}^00I should take a look at it.
^00The Veiled House.{LF}^00From the Shrine of Dolls, into a cave...{LF}This may be the same route Yuri took.{LF}^00I should start by going there.
Maybe I'll also find out some more about that Postmortem Photograph.
Ren, aren't we going to search the Shrine of Dolls?
Ren, the video showed the Shrine of Dolls.{LF}That's this way.
I should check out the Shrine of Dolls.
^00Ren, you're going the wrong way.{LF}^00Let's try another direction...
^00The door is being held shut by a powerful force.{LF}^00Are we locked in?
The door is being held shut by a powerful force.
^00What was that?{LF}^00Rui...where did you go?
^00It's Rui's journal.{LF}^00If I use this as a token, I can follow the trace{LF}to wherever Rui has been taken.
^00Rui seems to be OK...{LF}I have to find the way to the Veiled House.{LF}^00Yuri said there's an entrance to a cave below{LF}the doll display in the front shrine.
^00There are stairs leading underground below the doll display.{LF}I might be able to reach this "Womb Cavern" through there.{LF}^00But first, I have to find Rui...
^00The heavy lattice door is locked.{LF}An iris flower is engraved on the lock.{LF}^00^30~052~You inserted the ^11~09~Iris Plate Key^10 into the lock.
The door won't budge.
The door won't budge.
^00^30~066~It's exactly the same as the picture from that photo album...{LF}^00Did Kazuya come here because of it too?
There's light coming from inside.{LF}Is someone in there?
Kunihiko Aso...{LF}Was Dr. Aso somehow involved in this?
Mist is pouring into the room...{LF}That's not a good sign. I should get out of here.
What the...
^00The path to the Veiled House is overgrown with vegetation.{LF}I doubt I'll be able to find it again.
The lock is broken.{LF}I can't open the door.
The door is being held shut by a powerful force.
The door is being held shut by a powerful force.
^00Was that...one of Keiji Watarai's memories?{LF}^00I have to get out of here.
^00You got the Bind Lens.
^00The door is locked.{LF}^00The Camera Obscura is reacting to it...
The door won't budge.
^00It's a finely decorated black wooden box.{LF}The lid is shut and I can't get it open.
^00It's a finely decorated black wooden box.{LF}The lid is shut and I can't get it open.
^00Was that...Haruka?{LF}Did she come out of this box?{LF}^00Yuri said she found her in a black box...{LF}Is there someone in each of these?
^00It's a finely decorated black wooden box.{LF}The lid is shut and I can't get it open.
^00The ladder leads up to the attic.{LF}Just like in the last part of the video...
^00What the...?{LF}The ghost left a notebook behind when it disappeared.
This must be the Shrine of Dolls that was in the video.
It's an ornamental book stand.
^00This leads outside the Unfathomable Forest.{LF}I have to find the Shrine of Dolls in the middle of the forest.
^00I have to find Rui.{LF}^00The Veiled House is accessible through the cave{LF}located under the Shrine of Dolls.
The Veiled House is accessible through the cave{LF}located under the Shrine of Dolls.
I might as well use the cable car.
The exit leading to the Veiled House must be somewhere in this cave.
The ghost dropped something when it disappeared.
