Mother...^01~90~
Ever since I was little I could see things{LF}that were invisible to others.^01~240~
No one understood me except my brother.^01~150~
But then he left me, and I was all alone... {LF}Just me and my pain.^01~270~
But... {LF}I don't need him to be with me.^01~150~
^00I just...{LF}I just wish I could see him one more time.^01~150~{LF}^00Just one more time...^01~285~
Before I disappear...forever.^01~180~
